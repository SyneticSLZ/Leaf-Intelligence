The first visit is a screening visit, which will take about one hour to determine eligibility. If participants are eligible, participants will be scheduled for a baseline visit and 6 monthly visits to determine the antidepressant effects and possible side effects."

Evidence of alcohol or other substance use disorder in the past 3 months\n2. For females: current pregnancy or lactation (women of reproductive potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening).\n3. Depressed patients who have failed at least one adequate antidepressant trial during the current depressive episode based on the ATRQ.\n4. Diagnosis of other primary psychiatric disorder (defined in this case as being the main focus of treatment) as determined by the MINI, such as: bipolar disorder, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, dissociative disorders, eating disorder, or cognitive task due to neurological conditions\n5. Systolic blood pressure \\< 150 and/or diastolic blood pressure \\< 90 at screening\n6. Post-partum state (being within 2 months of delivery or miscarriage)\n7. Imminent suicide or homicide risk as determined by the investigator\n8. Being treated with one of the following medications: benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants.\n9. No clinically significant neurological disease based on medical history (e.g., epilepsy) or significant head injury.\n10.

The presence of clinically significant laboratory findings in the opinion of the investigator including, but not limited to, clinically significant anemia or transaminase elevation is considered exclusionary.\n12. If the UDS is positive, the subject would be excluded if, in the opinion of the investigator, the positive UDS meant the subject has an active substance use disorder.\n13. Patients with prior exposure to VNS therapy whether using an implantable or external device will be excluded.\n14. An active implantable medical device, such as a pacemaker, hearing aid implant, or any implanted electronic device\n15. A metallic device, such as a stent, bone plate, or bone screw, implanted at or near the neck\n16. An open wound, rash, infection, swelling, cut, sore, drug patch, or surgical scar(s) on the neck at the treatment location\n17. Patients diagnosed with narrowing of the arteries (carotid atherosclerosis)\n18. Patients who have had surgery to cut the vagus nerve in the neck (cervical vagotomy)\n19.
