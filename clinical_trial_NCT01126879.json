      "briefSummary": "RATIONALE: Genistein may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well genistein works in treating patients with prostate cancer.",
      "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine whether genistein treatment will decrease the number of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in the peripheral blood as measured by qRT-PCR for PSA performed on RNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the natural history of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in a cohort of subjects prior to and post radical prostatectomy.\n\nII. Compare the measurement of PSA between three separate methods: in CPCs by qRT-PCR, in serum by the standard clinical chemistry assay (i.e., ELISA), and in plasma and serum by the nano-PSA assay.\n\nIII. Measure the effect of genistein on gene and protein expression in prostate tissue by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, for the following genes and their respective protein products: HSP27, MMP-2, ALK-2, BASP1, and HCF2.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive oral genistein once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month prior to radical prostatectomy.\n\nARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month prior to radical prostatectomy.\n\nAll patients undergo radical prostatectomy at least 2 weeks, but not more than 3 months following the start of therapy.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 6, and 12 months."
