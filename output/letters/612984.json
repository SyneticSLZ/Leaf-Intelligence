We reviewed your product listings for Berberine, Echinacea, Elderberry Immune Support, Milk Thistle, Lion’s Mane Mushroom, and Green Lipped Mussels. Examples of some of the claims observed that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\nOn your Berberine Amazon product page at https://www.amazon.com/Berberine-500mg-Added-Chromium-Gastrointestinal/dp/B086J6YNLH/:\n\n“Fresh Nutrition Berberine and Chromium Benefits? … lower blood sugar and cholesterol … natural support to women with PCOS by regulating insulin and glucose levels.”\n\nOn your Echinacea Amazon product page at https://www.amazon.com/Echinacea-Strongest-Conditions-Depression-Infections/dp/B07WSRFHTZ/:\n\n“Echinacea… Pain Reliever, Anxiety, Depression, Fight Infections”\n“Fresh Nutrition Echinacea Benefits? … Natural Pain Reliever… Anxiety, Depression, Antibiot [sic] Properties, Fight Infections… Inflammation…”\n\nOn your Elderberry Immune Support Amazon product page at https://www.amazon.com/Elderberry-Immune-Support-Strongest-Verified/dp/B086RRMWSK:\n\n“Fresh Nutrition Elderberry Benefits? … Antibiot [sic] Properties, Fight Infections…”\n\nOn your Milk Thistle Amazon product page at https://www.amazon.com/Milk-Thistle-Organic-Sylimarin-Standardized/dp/B01NC34QAX:\n\n“Cure Your Hangover Fast; Milk Thistle … helps speed up the recovery process for your liver, getting rid of your hangover faster!”\n“Taking the product on a regular basis before drinking may also aid in reducing the possibility of a hangover in the morning.”\n\nOn your Lion’s Mane Mushroom Amazon product page at https://www.amazon.com/Mushroom-Capsules-Strongest-1500mg-Special/dp/B07BD3DHZG/:\n\n“Lions Mane Mushrooms have been shown to have many benefits, mainly improved cognitive function and brain health caused through regeneration, remyelination and increased nerve growth factor (NGF).

With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour products Berberine, Echinacea, European Elderberry, Fish Oil, Lion’s Mane Mushroom, Milk Thistle, and Turmeric Curcumin are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your products Berberine, Echinacea, European Elderberry, Fish Oil, Lion’s Mane Mushroom, Milk Thistle, and Turmeric Curcumin fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nUnapproved New Animal Drugs\n\nDuring our review of your website (https://fresh-nutrition.com) and Amazon product pages, FDA determined that your Green Lipped Mussels product is also intended for use in the mitigation, treatment, or prevention of diseases in animals, which makes it a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)]. Further, as discussed below, this product is an unapproved new animal drug and marketing it violates the Act.\n\nExamples of claims observed on your website (https://fresh-nutrition.com) that establish the intended use of your product as a drug include:\n\nOn your Green Lipped Mussels product page at https://fresh-nutrition.com/products/greenlipped-mussel-90-capsules:\n\n“Great for dogs and humans alike! Main benefits are… joint pain, range of motion, … inflammation, arthritis”\nOn the picture of your product label: “These nutrients [in Green Lipped Mussels] have been shown to ease joint pain”\n\nFurthermore, you operate an Amazon storefront under the name, Fresh Nutrition. We reviewed your product listings for Green Lipped Mussels. Examples of claims observed that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include:\n\nOn your Green Lipped Mussels Amazon product page at https://www.amazon.com/Green-Lipped-Mussel-Capsules-Canaliculus/dp/B07WTQ6W5S/:\n\n“Green Lipped Mussel Capsules … for Hip and Joint Relief – Joint Pain Supplement”\n“Great for dogs and humans alike! Main benefits are… joint pain, range of motion, inflammation, arthritis”\nOn the picture of your product label: “These nutrients [in Green Lipped Mussels] have been shown to ease joint pain”\n\nBased on our review, this product is a \"new animal drug\" under section 201(v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(v)] because it is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. It is not the subject of an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. New animal drugs that are not the subject of an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing are unsafe under section 512(a) of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)], and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products.
