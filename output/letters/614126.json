We have also reviewed your website at Internet address www.bluepoppy.com, which you link to your website www.peopleherbs.com, your Amazon Marketplace webpage, and three of your social media websites. Your social media sites https://www.facebook.com/ PeoplesHerbs/ and https://twitter.com/peoples herbs?lang=en direct consumers to your product website, www.peoplesherbs.com, where products can be purchased. Additionally, your Instagram feed is accessible from your main page on your website www.peoplesherbs.com.\n\nThe claims on your websites and social media pages establish that your products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing, or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\nModified Perilla & Mentha\n\nOn your webpage for Modified Perilla & Mentha at www.peoplesherbs.com:\n\n“CHINESE MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS: Gu chong (gu worms) leading to xie xie (diarrhea), xia li (dysentery), xiao fu tong (lower abdominal pain)…”\n“PATTERN DISCRIMINATION: Spleen qi vacuity with stomach and intestinal dampness and heat complicated by liver depression, stomach fluid dryness, and heart qi and blood vacuity”\n“THERAPUTIC[sic] ACTIONS:…combats gu and kills worms.”\n“INDICATIONS: This formula is for spleen qi vacuity with stomach and intestinal dampness and heat complicated by liver depression, stomach fluid dryness, and heart qi and blood vacuity. In terms of disease indications, it treats gu parasites with abdominal distention, loose stools or diarrhea, and abdominal cramping. Patients with this scenario have usually been diagnosed as suffering from intestinal parasites, intestinal dysbiosis, candidiasis, leaky gut syndrome, food allergies, and/or hypoglycemia. They may have irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, ME, or chronic allergic rhinitis/sinusitis.”\n\nOn the Modified Perilla & Mentha webpage found at www.bluepoppy.com:\n\n“…[W]idely applicable in cases of various types of digestive weakness that include a history of multiple parasitic infections.”\n“Consider in cases of spleen qi vacuity with intestinal damp heat complicated by liver depression, stomach dryness, heart qi and blood vacuity.”\n\nEmpowered Cordyceps\n\nOn your webpage for Empowered Cordyceps at www.peoplesherbs.com:\n\n“Cordyceps has significant health benefits including being one of the best substances an asthmatics can include in their diet; a well-regarded tonic to help with recovery from long-term or significant illnesses…”\n“Cordyceps is also regarded traditionally as a recovery tonic. In China it is often employed to help people recover from long-term or significant illnesses…It is thought to have a particularly strengthening effect on kidney and lung function.”\n“Sexual debility is an ever-increasing issue in modern life. One need only watch television to note the many drug ads for pills to elevate sexual performance. In the U.S. it is estimated that 5% of 40 year-old men and 15-25% of 65 year old men have erectile dysfunction. This is another area, along with its role on the training table of athletes, where demand is driving the overharvesting. The sex drive is so central to one’s sense of well-being that people will pay a king’s ransom for a product that holds out hope for remedying the loss of sexual vitality. And Chinese studies do seem to indicate there is some hope for help with Cordyceps, even when consumed in a modest dose.”\n\nAdditionally, similar claims are present on your Amazon Marketplace product webpage.\n\nEmpowered Reishi\n\nOn your webpage for Empowered Reishi at www.peoplesherbs.com:\n\n“Reishi…can help with…support role with various types of cancer…”\n“…[H]elp with blood sugar regulation.”\n“…Reishi is valued world-wide for its use in a wide range of conditions.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d), § 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug based on scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour products Modified Perilla & Mentha, Empowered Cordyceps, Empowered Reishi, Sui Bian Guo, and Stop Pain Tincture are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Modified Perilla & Mentha, Empowered Cordyceps, Empowered Reishi, Sui Bian Guo, and Stop Pain Tincture products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour response should be sent to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Amy R.
