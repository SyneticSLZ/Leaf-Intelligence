The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your website at the internet address https://www.lanomax.com in August and September 2023 and has determined that you promote and offer this product for sale there.\n\nBased on our review of your website at the internet address https://www.lanomax.com, your Lanomax® product is a drug under section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)], because this product is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. This product is an unapproved new animal drug and introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nCurrently there are no FDA-approved eye drops for use in animals that are labeled for treating, preventing, mitigating, or curing cataracts. Your product, which claims to treat this condition, has not been determined by FDA to be safe and effective. Your unproven treatment could cause animal owners to forgo or delay appropriate veterinary care.\n\nYou can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\n\nExamples of claims FDA observed on your website and product labeling that show the intended use of your Lanomax® product include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nFrom your home website titled “LANOMAX®” at the URL https://www.lanomax.com/:\n\n“Lanomax® is the only eye drop on the planet currently that has a real therapeutic effect on cataracts.”\n“…in the case of incipient, immature, and mature cataracts, if you administer two vials of Lanomax® eye drops to one eye for six weeks, you will see visible improvements compared to the untreated eye.”\n“…there are dramatic cases where a visible effect is even noticed within a short period of 1-2 weeks after beginning to administer Lanomax®.”\n\nFrom your webpage titled “LANOMAX®” at the URL https://www.lanomax.com/retail/index.php/lanomax.html:\n\n“Lanomax® can cure cataracts in the form of eye drops alone…”\n“Lanomax® uses ThruDelivery®, an innovative drug delivery system built using the latest advanced nanotechnology…It is because of this ThruDelivery® system that Lanomax® is the only eye drop on the planet to show a real therapeutic effect on cataracts.”\n“Currently, this amazing lanosterol delivery system is only found in Lanomax® eye drops.”\n“Lanomax® has an excellent therapeutic effect on incipient, immature, and mature cataracts.”\n“The therapeutic effect of Lanomax® varies greatly depending on the type of cataract and the degree of its progression.”\n“Sometimes there are dramatic cases where a visible effect can even be noticed within a short period of 1-2 weeks beginning to administer Lanomax®.”\n\nFrom your webpage titled “FAQ” at the URL https://www.lanomax.com/retail/index.php/faq.html:\n\n“Can Lanomax® be used for animals such as birds, minks or horses? Lanomax® can be used for cataracts that occur in all kinds of animals.”\n“Can I use Lanomax® for animals with diabetes? Lanomax® is safe for use on animals with age-related diseases, including diabetes.”\n“Can Lanomax® be used on animals with glaucoma? Does it increase the intraocular pressure? Lanomax® is safe for use on animals with glaucoma; it will not affect the intraocular pressure.”\n“Do I need a prescription and veterinarian involved to use Lanomax®? No, Lanomax® does not require consulting a veterinarian or getting a prescription.”\n“During the use of Lanomax®, the cataracts split into multiple fragments. What causes this? It is a desirable phenomenon to see the protein aggregation (the cause of cataract) is dissolving. This is nothing to be alarmed about and you should continue the treatment.”\n“Must I continue to use Lanomax® after the cataracts are completely cured? … you may want to continue to use a low dose of Lanomax® as a preventative measure against the recurrence of cataracts.”\n\nOn your webpage titled “Reviews” at the URL https://www.lanomax.com/retail/index.php/reviews.html:\n\n\"…I found out about Lanomax…the progression has stopped and his eyes have remained stable every [sic] since…”\n\"…was completely blind due to diabetic cataracts. Thanks to Lanomax, his cataracts are dissolving and he can see again…”\n\"…I'm writing to tell you your lanomax eye drops helped my dogs [sic] vision immensely…”\n\"Just want you to know that Lanomax is helping…He can see something out of his cataract eye [sic] that is not hyper mature.”\n\"…has severe cataract on his left eye. We have applied Lanomax on both eyes…We think Lanomax is also helping the right eye from developing cataract.\"\n\"Lanomax works well and my dog's vision has improved…”\n\"To all who have cataract animals!! This product truly works…”\n\nThis product is a new animal drug under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. 321(v)], because it is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. This product is not approved or index listed by FDA, and therefore, the product is unsafe within the meaning of section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)], and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated drug is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product.
