We also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/purecraftcbd and https://www.instagram.com/purecraftcbd/, where you direct consumers to your website, https://purecraftcbd.com/, to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that your website offers cannabidiol (CBD) products for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191 in people. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).\n\nThere is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.2 In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.3 Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.\n\nSome examples of the claims on your website that establish the intended use of your products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:\n\nFrom the July 1, 2022 blog post titled “CBD & COVID-19: NEW RESEARCH, NEW FINDINGS [JUNE 2022]” on your webpage https://purecraftcbd.com/blogs/news/cbd-and-covid-new-research-and-findings:\n\n“* This post covers research that was published since our July 6, 2021 postReviewing [sic] Research on CBD for COVID-19 Therapy (which we suggest reading if you need an overview of how COVID-19 works in the body). To the best of our knowledge, the studies referenced in this article all used therapeutic-grade CBD that was purer or contained higher concentrations of cannabidiol than what’s on the market for public consumption. . . .\n\nCOVID Prevention & CBD . . .\n\nEarly results show that therapeutic doses of CBD do have a protective effect against COVID. . . . According to the National Institute of Health’s COVID-19 Research initiative:(1)\n\nCBD is the only cannabinoid that exhibited a protective quality. When paired with THC, the preventive effect diminished.\nPeople who take CBD-based medications (like Epidiolex) reported fewer COVID diagnosis than other populations.\nMore research in humans is needed but CBD be [sic] part of the COVID prevention protocol — along with (not in place of) vaccination, masking, and social distancing.\n\nCBD vs SARS-CoV-2 . . .\n\n[T]he CBD does start to attach the virus very soon after the virus is introduced into your system.\n\nThis anti-SARS-CoV-2 assault makes it so that the virus can’t spread or further develop. Basically, the CBD inhibits the virus’s capacity to replicate itself or change host cells in your body. CBD blocks the viral reproduction by activating the infected cell’s stress response, which makes it create virus-killing proteins. . . .\n\nCBD For COVID Symptoms\nAccording to a March 2022 article in Frontiers in Immunology, CBD has been shown to decrease the severity of COVID. It’s primarily doing this by counteracting the body’s inflammatory response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. . . . .\n\nWill cannabis or cannabinoids protect you from COVID?\nCurrent research indicates that therapeutic doses of CBD may provide some protection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The purer or higher concentration the CBD, the more effective this intervention seems to be.”\n\nFrom the July 6, 2021 blog post titled “REVIEWING RESEARCH ON CBD FOR COVID-19 THERAPY” on your webpage https://purecraftcbd.com/blogs/news/reviewing-research-on-cbd-for-covid-19-therapy:\n\n“Interest from the medical community about the usefulness of CBD in battling the COVID-19 virus isn’t completely out of left field…\n\n[S]everal studies have emerged that are expected to progress our understanding of CBD’s therapeutic potential for COVID patients. . . .\n\nHypothesis #1: CBD May Be An Option For COVID-19 Prevention\nSince contracting COVID-19 puts some at a higher risk of death and long-term effects, one study is focusing on the use of CBD for infection prevention. . . . They cultivated 800 new strains of Cannabis sativa L. Of these, 13 high-CBD strains were selected, which decreased the presence of ACE2 in 3D models of human respiratory and intestinal tissues. . . .\n\nHypothesis #2: CBD May Reduce Inflammation Related To COVID-19\nCan CBD help combat inflammation from a cytokine storm caused by COVID-19?\n\nTwo studies using in vitro lung cell cultures have completed early stages of answering this question.(5, 6)\n\nIn the first study, the lung cultures were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. . . . The high-CBD formula reduced inflammation considerably, whereas the high-THC formula had little anti-inflammatory effect. The high-CBD formula reduced the specific cytokines responsible for the COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. . . .\n\nIn the second study, CBD was found to halt viral replication. The researchers also concluded that CBD was more effective than THC. In fact, of the cannabinoids that were tested, CBD was found to be the only cannabinoid that produced this outcome. This study has not yet been peer reviewed, but is a promising line of investigation.\n\nHypothesis #3: CBD May Be Helpful In The Treatment Of COVID-19 . . .\nIn another study performed on mice experiencing respiratory distress due to an artificially-induced cytokine storm, CBD reversed the negative effects and restored homeostasis.(8) This suggests that CBD may support recovery from the virus.\n\nCurrent Findings Spark More Questions\nWith the facts on the known relationship between CBD and COVID-19 laid out, it’s clear that further research and incoming results will reveal CBD’s role and effectiveness as a therapeutic tool. For now, the medical community and the world have earmarked these findings as a pivotal and encouraging chapter amidst the rollercoaster plot of the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\nFrom a July 10, 2022 post on your Instagram webpage https://www.instagram.com/p/Cf2HNUtJLtQ/, and a July 8, 2022 post on your Facebook webpage https://www.facebook.com/purecraftcbd, which links to your July 1, 2022 blog post:\n\n“CBD & COVID-19: NEW RESEARCH, NEW FINDINGS [JUNE 2022] . . .\n\nSo, keep reading for the latest coronavirus-CBD research on:\n- Whether preventing COVID with CBD is possible\n- How CBD interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID)\n- The COVID and cannabinoid receptors link\n- Potential CBD benefits for COVID symptoms\n- If CBD can curb COVID vaccination side effects”\n\nFrom a July 6, 2021 post on your Facebook webpage https://www.facebook.com/purecraftcbd, which links to your July 6, 2021 blog post:\n\n“REVIEWING RESEARCH ON CBD FOR COVID-19 THERAPY. . . CBD is being examined as a possible therapy for COVID-19 . . . .”\n\nYou should take immediate action to address this matter. This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products or operations. It is your responsibility to ensure that the products you sell are in compliance with the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act. Within 48 hours, please send an email to COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to address any violations.
