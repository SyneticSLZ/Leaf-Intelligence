We have also reviewed your social media website www.facebook.com/saffronhealthsci/, which directs customers to https://saffronhealthsci.com to purchase your products, and your firm’s store at www.amazon.com. The claims on these websites establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, including COVID-19 in people1.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in Sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves new drugs on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under Section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in Section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour Crocin Rich, Crocin Rich II, and Crocin Rich Plus are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Crocin Rich, Crocin Rich II, and Crocin Rich Plus fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates Section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete addressing these violations within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour written response should be sent to the following address: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 11155 Dolfield Boulevard, Suite 117, Owings Mills, Maryland 21117.

The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19. Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.",
