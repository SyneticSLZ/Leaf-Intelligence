Dogris\nCEO & Co-Founder/Co-Owner\nNeuroField, Inc.\n\n386 West Line Street\nBishop, CA 93514-3413\nUnited States\n\n nicholasdogris@verizon.net\nIssuing Office:\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\nCMS # 621767\n\nFebruary 28, 2022\n\nDear Mr. Dogris:\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your medical device operations located at 386 W. Line Street, Bishop, CA from September 28 through October 6, 2021. During the inspection, an FDA Investigator determined that your firm manufactures neurostimulation and electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing devices, including the NeuroField X3000/X3000 Plus, NeuroField Q21, and software products NeuroField64, and NeuroField EEG. Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of diseases or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nOur inspection and review of the available information, including the firm’s website, revealed that the NeuroField X3000/X3000 Plus, NeuroField Q21, NeuroField64, and NeuroField EEG are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g), for these devices as described and marketed. The devices are also misbranded under section 502(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the devices into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency per 21 CFR 807.81(b).\n\nNeurofield, Inc., has registered and listed the NeuroField X3000 and NeuroField Q21 as biofeedback devices under 21 CFR 882.5050. A biofeedback device classified under 21 CFR 882.5050 is identified as “an instrument that provides a visual or auditory signal corresponding to the status of one or more of a patient's physiological parameters (e.g., brain alpha wave activity, muscle activity, skin temperature, etc.) so that the patient can control voluntarily these physiological parameters.” The device is classified as class II and subject to general and special controls. Per 21 CFR 882.5050(b), this device type is exempt from the premarket notification procedures (510(k) when it is a prescription battery powered device that is indicated for relaxation training and muscle reeducation and prescription use, subject to 21 CFR 882.9.\n\nHowever, based on our review of materials collected during the inspection and other available information, including statements on your firm’s website, http://neurofield.org (last visited 01/24/2022), as described below, these devices are intended for uses that exceed or otherwise differ from the classification codified at 21 CFR 882.5050, such that premarket notification is required prior to introduction or delivery for introduction of these devices into interstate commerce for commercial distribution per 21 CFR 882.9.\n\nNeuroField X3000/X3000 Plus\n\nStatements on your firm’s website and the manual for the NeuroField64 X3000 indicate the NeuroField X3000/X3000 Plus is intended for stimulation-based treatment use, which is an intended use beyond the scope of the biofeedback device classification per 21 CFR 882.5050.\n\nExamples of such statements from your website include but are not limited to:\n\n“The X3000 Plus is a low intensity 4 channel pEMF (pulsed electromagnetic field) generator using four 400-wind coil packs for precision placement anywhere on the body.”\n“The frequency range from 0.31Hz to 300,000Hz, output intensity range from 1-100 microTesla (uT), and the ability to generate sine, triangle, and square waveforms means the X3000 Plus is one of the most flexible pEMF generators in the industry.”\n“[T]he X3000 Plus is the first pEMF system in the world to combine stimulation with z-score, norm referenced operant conditioning methods.”\n“If you wish to run stimulation therapies, take a look at our X3000 or Genesis.”\n“The X3000 is a STIMULATION ONLY unit, and it does not record any data.”\n“Package Contents: X3000 Plus Stim Unit”\n\nExamples of such statements from the manual for the NeuroField64 X3000 include but are not limited to:\n\n“The NeuroField X3000 is pEMF stimulator that is designed to deliver low intensity pEMF to the person.”\n“The X3000 ships with four pEMF coils. Plug them into the front of the unit. Once connected they are ready to use.”\n“This chapter will give you a step-by-step tutorial of how to deliver pEMF with the X3000.”\n\nNeuroField Q21\n\nStatements on your website and the manual for the NeuroField64 Q21 indicate the NeuroField Q21 is intended for use as an electroencephalograph (EEG), which is a device use that falls within classification regulation 21 CFR 882.1400 and is not exempt from premarket notification requirements.\n\nExamples of such statements from the firm’s website include but are not limited to:\n\n“The Q21 is a 19+1 channel Electroencephalogram with a low noise floor of 0.25 μV peak to peak from 0.1 to 10.0Hz, meaning that you can record EEG without worrying about noise contamination.”\n“The Q21 is a Quantitative Electroencephalograph . . . .”\n\nExamples of such statements from the manual for the NeuroField64 Q21 include but are not limited to:\n\n“At the time of the QEEG, ask client to remove any earrings or clips/pins in the hair that would sit beneath the cap.”\n“The ‘Q2x QEEG User Interface’ will open. This is where you can start and stop your scans.”\n\nNeuroField64 and NeuroField EEG\n\nIn addition, FDA notes that your firm’s website and materials collected during the inspection include references to software products called “NeuroField64” and “NeuroField EEG.” Statements on your firm’s website and in the manuals for the NeuroField64, NeuroField64 X3000, and NeuroField64 Q21 describe the use of the NeuroField64 and NeuroField EEG software products in conjunction with NeuroField X3000/X3000 Plus and NeuroField Q21, as well as functions of the software products such that the software products appear to meet the definition of device under section 201(h) of the Act.\n\nExamples of such statements from your firm’s website include but are not limited to:\n\n“NeuroField64 is a 64-bit program that brings together all of NeuroField’s hardware products and features into one platform!”\n“The X3000 Plus is a software-controlled system which is fully customizable all the way down to the easy-to-use patient database.” The specifications for X3000 Plus identify NeuroField64 as the compatible software.\n“X3000 Package Details . . . Access to NeuroField64”\n“NeuroField EEG is a 64-bit program module, used in conjunction with NeuroField’s Q21 Amplifier that marks the beginning of our journey into EEG recording and analysis.”\n“Record EEG in a pristine 24-bit resolution with a frequency range of 0.5 - 70 Hz range.”\n\nExamples of such statements from the manuals for the NeuroField64, NeuroField64 X3000, and NeuroField64 Q21 include but are not limited to:\n\n“This chapter will give you a step-by-step tutorial of how to deliver pEMF with the X3000. The following tutorial requires that you have installed NeuroField64 on your computer.”\n“In NeuroField64 you can not only acquire stand-alone EEG using either device, you can also use either the Q20 or Q21 to synchronize EEG with stimulation (pEMF, tACS, or both) during a single session.”\n“This chapter will give you a step-by-step tutorial of how to record EEG with the Q21 EEG amplifier. The following tutorial requires that you have installed NeuroField64 on your computer.”\n\nYou are also promoting NeuroField devices on other websites and social media (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram), for uses that are beyond the scope of the biofeedback device classification at 21 CFR 882.5050, such as recording QEEG data, neurostimulation, and treatment of various medical conditions. During a review of the websites https://schoolofneurotherapy.com and https://neurofieldneurotherapy.com, which each contain information indicating ownership or control of the websites by NeuroField CEO Nicholas Dogris, FDA observed claims related to NeuroField devices, including but not limited to the following:\n\n“Neurofield 2-Day EEG & ERP Course . . . This two-day course is dedicated to the clinical use of event related potentials, the measure of electrical potential created from time-locked events, as well as Neurofield EEG, a recording and EEG analysis platform that quantifies data into QEEG format.”\n“pEMF, also known as pulsed electromagnetic field stimulation, creates a difference in how our neurons fire and can be like physical therapy for the brain. The X3000 is programmable so that we can choose the frequency to be delivered from between 0.31 Hz to 300,000 Hz, depending on the desired treatment outcome.” Below this statement, there is a link to “LEARN ABOUT OUR PEMF EQUIPMENT” that takes the user to the firm’s Products webpage https://neurofield.org/neurofieldproducts.\n“PEMF is an incredibly versatile treatment. We place the coils around the head for brainwave entrainment and coherence. This is because the consistent rhythm of the stimulation helps neurons synchronize. We also frequently place coils on the belly for inflammation reduction, and around joints for arthritis, fibromyalgia, and other ailments.”\n“we often use the system (hardware and software) developed by Neurofield Inc., which is synchronized neurofeedback and neurostimulation training. We have found that this modality is much faster than other forms of neurofeedback-only, since we can first demonstrate to the brain what we would like it to achieve, and then reward those results (neurofeedback-only models do not demonstrate to the brain how to behave, which makes for a much longer period for the brain to catch on).”\n“PTSD responds well to neurotherapy. By addressing the physiology of the symptom, we are able to address the physics behind the conditioned response. After a number of sessions, it is common our clients experience a reduction in the disturbing symptoms of PTSD, becoming able to resume a normal life.” Below this statement, there is a link to “LEARN MORE ABOUT NEUROSTIMULATION” that takes the user to the NEUROSTIMULATION/NEUROMODULATION webpage. This webpage includes the following statement: “Neuromodulation not only sets us apart, but because of Neurofield’s inventions, there are hundreds of clinicians using Neurofield pEMF equipment in their clinical practices.”\n\nOur office requests that NeuroField cease any activities that result in the adulteration or misbranding of the NeuroField X3000/X3000 Plus, NeuroField Q21, NeuroField64, and NeuroField EEG, such as the commercial distribution of the devices for uses that exceed or otherwise differ from the classification codified at 21 CFR 882.5050, including the uses discussed above. The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the devices is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm.The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the products may be legally marketed.\n\nThis inspection also revealed that your devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. We received your firm’s response on October 26, 2021 from (b)(6), concerning our Investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483, List of Inspectional Observations (FDA 483) that was issued to your firm. Your firm indicated that you plan to submit an updated response by April 15, 2022. We address the response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to adequately maintain complaint files and establish procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit, as required by 21 CFR § 820.198(a). Specifically,\n\nYour firm failed to adequately establish complaint handling procedures as you did not conduct or document complaint investigation as required by your Corrective and Preventative and Complaint Handling Standard Operating Procedure, QAP-0600, Rev. 2. For example, our investigator reviewed fifteen Complaint Handling Forms that are associated with RMA reports related to coil damages, broken jack screws, X3000 unit not powering up, power cable loose, and software issues and found your complaint records did not always include details of the complaint, dates and results of investigation, reason investigation was not conducted, software name, unique device identifier or universal product code, or address of the complainant.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response and determined that it is not adequate. Your firm committed to updating complaint records and related procedures and forms to add clarity and directions for processing complaints. You indicated that you have retrained all your personnel and added a reviewer to ensure the completeness of your complaint handling process. However, the complaint records you provided in your response still lack adequate details and it is not clear how you evaluated for possible failure of a device to meet its specifications. In response to this letter, please include updates and supporting records of your corrective actions as they progress, including retrospective review of all potential complaints.\n\n2. Failure to adequately establish procedures for corrective and preventive action, as required by 21 CFR § 820.100(a). Specifically,\n\nYour CAPA procedure, Corrective and Preventative Action and Complaint Handling Standard Operating Procedure, QAP-0600 Rev.2, has not been adequately established and your CAPAs did not correct or prevent the identified quality problem from recurring. For example,\n\na. CAPA0001 was opened on 2/23/2018 to address complaint handling deficiencies related to 23 service reports on coil damages, broken jack screws, X3000 not powering up, power cable loose and no response to software input. Your firm’s QA approval of Closure and CAPA/Complaint Effectivity Evaluation dates are listed as 10/17/2019, the same date you listed for Corrective Actions(s) taken, such as SOP update, retraining and staff reassignment. Although your record states you found the CAPA to be effective, it is unclear what effectiveness check criteria were established and met. During the current inspection, the investigator found that your firm had not evaluated all 23 service reports for potential complaint investigation per your complaint handling process. Furthermore, the investigator identified additional complaint handling deficiencies.\n\nb. CAPA0003 was opened on 2/23/2018 to address the failure to establish a quality policy and objectives for quality, such as not appointing a management representative and not conducting internal audits by an individual who does not have direct responsibility. Your firm’s QA approval of Closure and CAPA/Complaint Effectivity Evaluation dates are listed as 5/24/2018, the same date you listed for Corrective Actions(s) taken, such as SOP update, retraining and organizational chart update. Although your record states you found the CAPA to be effective, it is unclear what effectiveness check criteria were established and met. During the current inspection, the investigator found that your firm did not conduct any internal audits.\n\nc. CAPA0007 was opened on 2/23/2018 to address failure to establish records of acceptable suppliers and contractors. Your firm’s QA Approval of Closure and CAPA/Complaint Effectivity Evaluation dates are listed as 3/25/2019, the same date listed for Corrective Action(s) taken, such as SOP and Form updates, critical supplier list update, and staff reassignment of duties. Although your record states you found the CAPA to be effective, it is unclear what effectiveness check criteria were established and met. During the current inspection, the investigator found you had not evaluated your critical suppliers per your procedures.\n\nd. CAPA0008 was opened on 2/23/2018 to address lack of equipment calibration and maintenance records for equipment such as (b)(4). Your firm’s QA Approval of Closure and CAPA/Complaint Effectivity dates are listed as 11/5/2020, the same date you listed for Corrective Action(s) taken to update your Production and Process Control procedure, QCP-0200, Rev. 2. Although your record states you found the CAPA to be effective, it is unclear what effectiveness check criteria were established and met. During the current inspection, the investigator found that your firm you did not conduct calibration of equipment used during manufacturing of your devices.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response and determined that it is not adequate. Your firm committed to updating your CAPA procedure and training your employees. Your firm provided a brief summary of CAPAs, and corresponding corrective/preventive action taken, and verification activities, but they do not provide sufficient details to fully assess the adequacy of your corrective actions to date and lack documentation to demonstrate that you have corrected your violations. In response to this letter, please include updates and supporting records of implementation of these corrective actions as they progress. Our website, https://www.fda.gov/training-and-continuing-education/cdrh-learn provides training and references which you may find useful in complying with the corrective and preventive action and other quality system requirements.\n\n3. Failure to adequately establish procedures to ensure that all purchased or otherwise received product and services conform to specified requirements, as required by 21 CFR § 820.50. Specifically,\n\nYour firm failed to perform supplier evaluations of all twelve of your critical suppliers on your Approved Supplier List (ASL), PUR100-1, that were scheduled to have supplier evaluation completed in 2019 and 2020. Your critical suppliers include (b)(4) and (b)(4); they provide PCB boards and printed circuit boards required for manufacturing the NeuroField X3000 and NeuroFieldQ21. We also note that your firm’s Purchasing and Supplier Control procedure, PUR100 Rev. 1, does not clearly define how your firm determines what makes a supplier noncritical (NC) or critical (C.) and your firm could not provide documentation to show how you determined the (b)(4) suppliers/vendors on your ASL to be either critical or noncritical.\n\nThe adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time. Your firm committed to reevaluating all your critical suppliers and identify any other suppliers that needs to be re-evaluated. You also committed to updating your procedure to include criteria to distinguish critical and non-critical suppliers and add a mechanism to alert suppliers of such re-evaluation. In response to this letter, please include updates and supporting records of implementation of these corrective actions as they progress.\n\n4. Failure to establish procedures to ensure equipment is routinely calibrated, inspected, checked and maintained, as required by 21 CFR § 820.72(a). Specifically,\n\nYour firm failed to ensure that equipment used during manufacturing of the NeuroField X3000/X3000 Plus and NeuroField Q21 are routinely calibrated, inspected, checked, and maintained. Affected equipment include (b)(4) used during your in-process or finished device manufacturing activities. For example, your (b)(4) calibration was done in 2019 with next due date of 10/2020, but our current inspection found you have not performed recalibration since 2019. It is unclear how you determine what equipment needs maintenance and at what frequency.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response and determined that it is not adequate. Your firm committed to retraining all personnel on your Production and Process Control procedure, QCP200, Rev. 2 where you state (b)(4) equipment calibration requirements are already included. Although calibration is mentioned in your SOP, QCP200 Rev. 2, it lacks details on provisions for handling, preservation and storage of equipment so that its accuracy and fitness for use are maintained. Furthermore, you did not submit any corresponding training records and supporting information on how you would track and monitor calibration activities to ensure your equipment is suitable for its intended purposes and is capable of producing valid results. In response to this letter please include updates and supporting records of implementation of these corrective actions as they progress.\n\n5. Failure to adequately establish procedures for management review, as required by 21 CFR 820.20(c). Specifically,\n\nYour Management Review of the Quality System Meetings procedure, QAP-300 Rev.1, effective 2/8/2019, requires that a formal Management Review Meeting will be held on an (b)(4) basis. Your firm failed to implement the procedure and did not conduct any management review meetings.\n\nThe adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time. Your firm committed to reviewing and updating the above procedure to ensure that it meets the requirements of 21 CFR 820.20(c) and training all staff on the SOP. You also stated you’ll conduct management review by the end of 2021. However, you did not submit any supporting documentation of your corrections. In response to this letter, please include updates and supporting records of implementation of these corrective actions as they progress.\n\n6. Failure to adequately establish procedures for quality audits, as required by 21 CFR § 820.22. Specifically,\n\nYour Internal Quality Audit procedure, QAP200 Rev. 1, effective 3/21/19, requires that the audit program will ensure that during the year, each applicable procedure will be audited at least (b)(4). Your firm failed to complete any internal audit since the procedure has been in effect. In addition, your procedure does not have requirements that audits shall be conducted by individuals who do not have direct responsibilities for the matters being audited.\n\nThe adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time. Your firm committed to completing the internal audits and to finding an external auditor to complete an audit of your firm’s Quality Management System. However, you did not submit supporting documentation of your corrections. In response to this letter please submit any updated internal audit procedures and scheduled audit dates and supporting records of implementation of these corrective actions as they progress.\n\nYour firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Other federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. Also, should FDA determine that your devices do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, please respond to FDA with your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour firm's response should be sent via e-mail to: Jessica Mu, Director of Compliance Branch, at oradevices3firmresponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please identify your response with CMS case #621767 when replying. If you have questions regarding the content of this letter, please contact Compliance Officer, Charles J. Chacko at 214-253-4939, or via email at charles.chacko@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nCAPT Nina Mezu-Nwaba, PharmD, MPH, MSc\nDeputy Director OHT5: Office of Neurological and Physical\nMedicine Devices Office of Product Evaluation and Quality\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\n/S/\n\nShari J.
