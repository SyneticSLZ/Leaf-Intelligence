Moon\nChief Financial Officer\nCellEra LLC\n\n1045 Reed Dr, Ste C\nMonroe, OH 45050\nUnited States\n\nIssuing Office:\nOffice of Medical Device and Radiological Health Division 1 – East\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\nCMS # 618209\n\nOctober 20, 2021\n\nDear Mr. Moon:\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your firm’s medical device operations at CellEra LLC, located at 1045 Reed Dr, Ste C, Monroe, OH 45050, from June 16 through July 8, 2021. During the inspection, FDA investigators determined that your firm is a specification developer and own label distributor of various sterile wound dressings with drug. Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nThis inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. We received a response, dated July 30, 2021 from Ken Heyl, Chief Product Officer, concerning our investigators’ observations noted on the Form FDA 483, List of Inspectional Observations (FDA 483) that was issued on July 8, 2021. We address the response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive actions and the failure to document corrective and preventive activities, as required by 21 CFR § 820.100.\n\nSpecifically, your firm does not have a written corrective and preventive action procedure and has failed to document your firm’s corrective actions.\n\nFor example, your firm made changes to your Instructions for Use (IFUs) of your sterile Vitále Silver Calcium Alginate wound dressing as a correction to the findings in the previous inspection ending 05/31/2019. However, your firm failed to implement this change and IFUs reviewed during the current inspection still include the following, which are claims not cleared in (b)(4):\n\n• The term “antimicrobial” was not changed to “antibacterial”\n• The statement “The silver-impregnated calcium alginate fibers, when in contact with wound exudate or blood, form a gel which creates a moist wound healing environment. The silver has an antimicrobial effect within the dressing upon various types of microorganisms including Staphylococcus Aureus and Escherichia Coli”.\n• The description of “Superficial or Deep” for wound-type.\n• The instruction “cleanse the wound with Vitále Cleanser Spray or physiological saline solution.”\n\nNone of your firm’s corrective action activities, including a report of corrective and removal (Z-2085-2019 / RES# 83281) that was reported to the Agency, were documented.\n\nThis is a repeated issue from the FORM FDA 483 issued on May 30, 2019 and discussed during the January 14, 2020 Regulatory Meeting.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response and conclude it is not adequate. Your response did not address the creation of a procedure for CAPA activities or your plan to document corrective and preventive actions.\n\nFurther, you provided an updated IFU for the Vitále Silver Calcium Alginate Dressings via email on July 30, 2021. However, you have not provided objective evidence that this new IFU has been approved, the date when the IFU will be included with Vitále Silver Calcium Alginate Dressings, your plan to address the devices currently on the market or ready for distribution that contain an IFU with language beyond what was originally cleared by the Agency under (b)(4). Further, your response did not address initiating a CAPA(s) for the above IFU changes.\n\n2. Failure to establish and maintain procedures to control the design of the device, as required by 21 CFR § 820.30.\n\nSpecifically, your firm has failed to establish design controls that include adequate procedures for design inputs, design outputs, design verifications, design validations, design reviews, design transfers, design changes and the establishment of a design history file.\n\nThis is a repeated issue from the FORM FDA 483 issued on May 30, 2019 and discussed during the January 14, 2020 Regulatory Meeting.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response and conclude it is not adequate. You do not address the establishment of procedures to control the design of devices developed by your firm. In your response, please provide your firm’s plan to address the lack of design control procedures and establishment of a design history file.\n\n3. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for the identification, documentation, validation or where appropriate verification, review, and approval of design changes before their implementation, as required by 21 CFR § 820.30(i).\n\nSpecifically, your firm indicated to our investigator that an estimated (b)(4) design changes have been made by your firm in the past (b)(4). Some of these design changes include changes to the IFUs for the Vitále Silver Calcium Alginate Dressings beyond the language cleared under (b)(4), the storage requirements for the Vitále Silver Calcium Alginate Dressings from \"Keep from Heat\" “below 77°F” to “41°F / 5°C – 104°F / 40°C”, a change to the sterilization method from (b)(4) to (b)(4), and a change to the shelf life of the Vitále Silver Calcium Alginate Ropes & Dressings from 2 years to 3 years. These design changes have been made without documentation to include validation, verification, review, and approval prior to implementation.\n\nThis is a repeated issue from the FORM FDA 483 issued on May 30, 2019 and discussed during the January 14, 2020 Regulatory Meeting.\n\nWe have reviewed your firm’s response and conclude it is not adequate. Your response indicated that you have drafted a form to use to make changes in products. Your response is not adequate because the “Product Change Request/Approval” form does not include the requirement or allow for documentation of validation, verification (where appropriate), or review of the design change prior to approval. Additionally, you did not provide a retrospective review of design changes your firm has conducted to ensure design change requirements have been met.\n\n4. Failure to establish and maintain procedures to ensure that all purchased or otherwise received product and services conform to specified requirements as required by 21 CFR § 820.50.\n\nSpecifically, your firm failed to develop purchasing control procedures and has not established and maintained the requirements, including quality requirements, that must be met by suppliers, contractors, and consultants.\n\nFor example, your firm utilizes (b)(4) contract manufacturers to manufacture the products distributed by your firm. There is no agreement(s) in place that the contract manufacturers agree to notify your firm of changes in the product so your firm can determine whether the changes may affect the quality of a finished device. The storage requirements, sterilization method, and shelf life were changed by the contract manufacturer of your Vitále Silver Calcium Alginate Ropes & Dressings without your firm’s knowledge or approval.\n\nThis is a repeated issue from the FORM FDA 483 issued on May 30, 2019 and discussed during the January 14, 2020 Regulatory Meeting.\n\nWe have reviewed your firm’s response and conclude it is not adequate. Your response indicated that a procedure would be provided by September 8, 2021. To date, a procedure has not been received. Further, your response does not mention how your firm intends to define the type and extent of control to be exercised over contract manufacturers of your products from making changes or if you intend to create an agreement to be notified of changes in products.\n\n5. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for acceptance of incoming product. Incoming product shall be inspected, tested, or otherwise verified as conforming to specified requirements as required by 21 CFR § 820.80(b).\n\nSpecifically, your firm failed to develop procedures for acceptance of incoming product nor does your firm perform any activities related to the acceptance of incoming product other than a visual inspection for noticeable damage to the shipping boxes and device cartons. For example, you stated that sterility certificates received from your contract manufacturers are simply filed and not reviewed.\n\nThis is a repeated issue from the FORM FDA 483 issued on May 30, 2019 and discussed during the January 14, 2020 Regulatory Meeting.\n\nWe have reviewed your firm’s response and conclude it is not adequate. Your response indicated that a procedure would be provided by September 8, 2021. To date, a procedure has not been received.\n\n6. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit as required by 21 CFR § 820.198.\n\nSpecifically, your firm failed to developed procedures for the receipt, review, and evaluation of complaints. For example, your firm receives oral complaints, but no record is made. Complaints received via your firm’s website are maintained in email format without any indication of evaluation by your firm.\n\nThis is a repeated issue from the FORM FDA 483 issued on May 30, 2019 and discussed during the January 14, 2020 Regulatory Meeting.\n\nWe have reviewed your firm’s response and conclude it is not adequate. Your response indicated that your plan to have a formally designated unit to handle complaints and a procedure to follow. This response also indicated that no procedure finish date has been established. To date, a procedure or anticipated date of completion have not been received.\n\n7. Failure to establish and maintain procedures to control all documents as required by 21 CFR § 820.40.\n\nWe have reviewed your firm’s response and conclude it is not adequate. Your response did not address the corrective actions you plan to take. It is unclear if your firm plans to create a document control procedure.\n\n8. Failure to establish and maintain procedures to adequately control environmental conditions, where environmental conditions could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on product quality. Environmental control system(s) shall be periodically inspected to verify that the system, including necessary equipment, is adequate and functioning properly. These activities shall be documented and reviewed as required by 21 CFR § 820.70(c).\n\nSpecifically, your firm’s Vitále Silver Calcium Alginate Dressings and Ropes, which are sterile medical devices, have specific temperature storage requirements. Your firm has not developed procedures to adequately control the environmental conditions needed to maintain the environmental requirements, to including storage temperatures, for your devices.\n\nThis is a repeated issue from the FORM FDA 483 issued on May 30, 2019 and discussed during the January 14, 2020 Regulatory Meeting.\n\nWe have reviewed your firm’s response and conclude it is not adequate. Your response indicated that you plan to draft a procedure with a deadline of January 31, 2022. In your response, please provide an explanation why this procedure will take until January 31, 2022 to be established. Additionally, please explain how your firm intends to verify that the (b)(4) temperature and humidity sensors currently in use at your firm are adequate and functioning properly.\n\nOur inspection also revealed that your Vitále Silver Calcium Alginate Dressings and Ropes are misbranded under Section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information regarding the device that is required by or under Section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 – Medical Device Reporting. Violation includes, but is not limited to:\n\n9. Failure to develop, maintain, and implement written Medical Device Reporting (MDR) procedures, as required by 21 CFR 803.17.\n\nSpecifically, your firm has not established procedures for timely and effective identification, communication, and evaluation of reportable events; a standardized review process for determining when an event meets reportability criteria; timely submission of MDRs to the FDA; or for compliance with the applicable documentation and recordkeeping requirements.\n\nWe have reviewed your firm’s response and conclude it is not adequate. In the response, your firm noted you plan to develop these procedures but have not established a date to develop the procedure.\n\nYour firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. Also, should FDA determine that your devices do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, please respond to FDA with your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned\ncorrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter.\n\nIf you have questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact Compliance Officer, Sean Moynihan at 410-779-5134 or at sean.moynihan@fda.hhs.gov. Please send your reply electronically to Gina Brackett, Director of Compliance Branch, at oradevices1firmresponse@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nArduino Frankovic\nActing Program Division Director\nOffice of Medical Device and Radiological Health\nDivision 1 – East\n\nCc:\n\nKen Heyl\nChief Product Officer\n2044 Grove Park Way\nBirmingham, AL 35242",
