The claims on your website establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s Internet home page at www.fda.gov.\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n\nExamples of some of the claims observed on your www.beeyoutiful.com website that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\n“Vitex w/ Dong Quai”\n\nOn the product page, under the Product Description tab:\n\n“[H]eadaches depression…constipation…are all eased by this wonderful herb.”\n“Uterine fibroids, fibrocystic breasts, and endometriosis are also the results of estrogen-dominance…Beeyoutiful’s Vitex addresses these mid-life problems.”\n\n“Berry Well”\n\nOn the product page, under the Product Description tab:\n\n“Berry Well is a practically miraculous combination of the following:”\n\n“[P]urple elderberries …. [t]he anti-viral powers of these immune system enhancers attack many strains of influenza A and B -- without the side effects or complications of a flu shot.”\n“Raw honey…delivers a rich supply of live enzymes required to help body systems fight colds and respiratory infections of all kinds.”\n“Bee propolis and Organic Echinacea root extract -- both considered powerful, natural antibiotics.”\n“Raw apple cider vinegar…increases your body's alkalinity. (Although today's diets tend to make us more acidic, an alkaline body is safer from cancer and other diseases.) And the potassium in raw vinegar helps cells fight bacteria and viruses.”\n\nOn the product page, the link to the article, Our Family Miracle:\n\n“No pharmaceutical currently on the market has been able to match the Elderberry’s ability to combat viruses and prevent their recurrence.”\n“Propolis [an ingredient in the firm’s Berry Well]…some people call it “Bee Antibiotic”\nWhite blood cells (phagocytes) serve as the body’s primary defense mechanism against bacterial infections…The same white blood cells are responsible for influencing production of antibodies which will wipe out harmful bacteria. Propolis has been found to initiate the activity and cleansing action of these lifesaving white blood cells.”\n“…other fantastic ingredients in BerryWell, honey supports healing on many levels…raw, unfiltered honey…used by many to help alleviate the symptoms of severe allergies and asthma”\n“Echinacea [an ingredient in the firm’s Berry Well]... Other components in Echinacea have been shown to have antibacterial and fungicidal activity. These elements have been found to slow down the spread of the bacteria rather than kill them outright like an antibiotic.”\n\nOn the product page, the link to the article, When Your Family Gets Sick:\n\n“Colds and upper-respiratory viruses get specific remedies around here…out comes the Berry Well”.\n“If I have any inkling that we’ve been exposed to a stomach virus…we all immediately start taking Berry Well and Tummy Tune Up…Take it a few times per day as prevention, or as often as every two hours when symptoms are present.”\n\nOn the product page, the link to the article, Swine Flu: Prevention and Treatment:\n\n“[O]therwise known as BerryWell…several studies show a clearly documented connection between elderberry extract and rapid T1 cytokine production. This is part of what makes it so very effective as an immune-boosting preventative measure against viruses – it can stop the virus in its track before it takes hold.”\n“[W]e have put together a convenient and significantly discounted Anti-Flu package. Included in this package are what we believe to be our most effective and beneficial products to arm and protect you and your family from any potentially dangerous flu. It contains BerryWell, Vitamin D3, Odorless Garlic, Tummy Tuneup, Ultimate Defense and Colostrum Transfer Factor.”\n\n“Cranberry Power Cleanse”\n\nOn the product page, in the Product Description section:\n\n“[C]ontains the herb uva ursi, long used for its healing powers over UTI's, cystitis, and kidney stones.”\n“Cranberries contain proanthocyanidins that can prevent the adhesion of certain bacteria (including E. coli) associated with urinary tract infections to the urinary tract wall. The antiadhesion properties of cranberry may also inhibit the bacteria associated with gum disease and stomach ulcers.”\n\n“Tummy Tuneup”\n\nOn the product page, under the Product Description tab in the section “How it Works,” your website states:\n\n“Before you consent to taking irritable bowel prescription medicines (which do have unwanted side effects), try putting yourself on a Tummy Tuneup™ regimen for awhile. If you're on an anti-yeast program, this pro-biotic is also an excellent accompaniment for Beeyoutiful's Yeast Assassin™ because a strong population of good bacteria is crucial to help combat yeast and fungal overgrowth.”\n\nOn the product page, the link to the article, Pre-Natal Preparation:\n\n“Tummy Tuneup…protecting against harmful bacteria.”\n\n“Colostrum Transfer Factor”\n\nOn the product page, under the Product Description tab:\n\n“Colostrum…expedite the body’s natural process of wound healing…”\n\nOn the product page, the link to the article, How Now?

Children and adults with acute or chronic diarrhea can be helped by taking a small, white capsule of colostrum such as Beeyoutiful’s Colostrum Transfer Factor.”\n\nFrom the “How Does It Help?” section of the article:\n\n    o “If you already have cancer, colostrum is a powerful ally in the fight. It contains phytic acid which inhibits iron from reaching and nourishing cancer cells. It also isolates and starves fungi and viruses which would otherwise thrive…”\n\nFrom the “How Do You Change the Past?” section of the article:\n\n    o “Fortunately, studies suggest that taking colostrum offers hope for stopping communicable diseases, whether Ebola, bird flu, AIDS, SARS, or the host of new antibiotic resistant illnesses on the rise.”\n    o “Consider the diseases that can be combated with colostrum….campylobacter, Candida and E. coli, clostridium (botulism), food poisoning, helicobacter pylori, listeria, rotavirus, salmonella, shigellosis, and streptococcus…colostrum counters leaky gut and irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, ulcers, chronic fatigue, diabetes, autoimmunity, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and cancers, and that it may even inhibit schleroderma [sic], fibromyalgia, and multiple sclerosis.”\n    o “Colostrum…may also accelerate the healing of injuries…”\n\n“Methylated Folate”\n\nOn the product page, under the Product Description tab:\n\n“Folate is well known for its role in …helping to prevent disorders such as Down Syndrome, Spina Bifida…early miscarriages.”\n“Folate’s role…plays a role in discouraging…colon disorders.”\n“[T]hose who can benefit from Methylated Folate are those…with mental or neurological disorders…”\n\n“Prostate Health*—Clinical Strength”\n\nOn the product page, under the Product Description tab:\n\n“Clinical Strength Prostate Health includes three ingredients…Saw Palmetto, Lycopene, and Beta-Sitosterol.

So supplementing with zinc is suggested to be beneficial in preventing prostate cancer.”\n“[T]here has been significant data to link low selenium [an ingredient in the firm’s Prostate Health*—Clinical Strength] levels to an increased risk for prostate cancer.”\n“Stinging Nettles[an ingredient in the firm’s Prostate Health—Clinical Strength]…is also known as an anti-inflammatory that can decrease the size of an enlarged prostate.”\n“Pumpkin seed oil[an ingredient in the firm’s Prostate Health—Clinical Strength]… can help to decrease an enlarged prostate by inhibiting hormonal activity responsibility [sic] for enlargement, decrease inflammation…”\n“Tumeric [sic] [an ingredient in the firm’s Prostate Health*—Clinical Strength] has been shown in studies to reduce the risk of prostate cancer.”\n“With the benefits that can help relieve an enlarged prostate and prevent/decrease the risk for prostate cancer…while helping to avoid…chronic diseases…”\n\n“D3”\n\nOn the product page, under the Product Description tab (in the “Why So Important?” section on your website):\n\n“Vitamin D…key in caring for osteoporosis, rickets, osteomalacia, and osteopenia.”\n“When the body is getting enough D to go around, it is used liberally by many cells that are able to make calcitriol and use its cancer-fighting properties!”\n“…D3 may help work against cancer.”\n“Blood sugar problems, low back pain, high blood pressure, type I and type II diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, kidney stones, psoriasis, depression, seasonal affective disorder, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome and auto-immune diseases have all been linked with low levels of vitamin D…”\n\n“Vitamin K2 + D3”\n\nOn the product page, under the Product Description tab:\n\n“…Vitamin K is even used to treat osteoporosis before turning to prescription drugs.”\n“Vitamin K may help…to eliminate the risk for caries and other dental problems.”\n“One study found that heart disease was literally cut in half in those taking Vitamin K.”\n“Vitamin K2 has a very crucial role in the nervous system in production of sulfatides, a lack of which can cause significant neural symptoms.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § § 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” mean directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour Vitex w/ Dong Quai, Berry Well, Cranberry Power Cleanse, Tummy Tuneup, Colostrum Transfer Factor, Prostate Health—Clinical Strength, D3, Vitamin K2 + D3, Dino Bones, Dynamic Duo A + D, Liquid D3, Gentle C, CoQ10, Bio B12, Liquid B12, Bromelain, Magnesium Citrate, Omega-3, Odorless Garlic, Selenium Secure, and Biome Blast (Yeast Assassin) products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Vitex w/ Dong Quai, Berry Well, Cranberry Power Cleanse, Tummy Tuneup, Colostrum Transfer Factor, Prostate Health—Clinical Strength, D3, Vitamin K2 + D3, Dino Bones, Dynamic Duo A + D, Liquid D3, Gentle C, CoQ10, Bio B12, Liquid B12, Bromelain, Magnesium Citrate, Omega-3, Odorless Garlic, Selenium Secure, and Biome Blast (Yeast Assassin) fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour written reply should be directed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Zada L. Giles, Compliance Officer, 404 BNA Drive, Suite 500, Nashville, TN 37217. If you have any questions with regard to this letter, please contact Zada L.
