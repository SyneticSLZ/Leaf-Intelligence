Under section 201 (rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and e-liquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901 (b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)).\n\nFDA has determined that the Caramel Stardust E-Liquid is misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)) because you sold this product to a person younger than 18 years of age. Additionally, FDA has determined that the ENDS and e-liquid products advertised and offered for sale or distribution on your website are misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)) and section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(A)) because your website regarding ENDS and e-liquid products fails to include the required nicotine warning statement for these ENDS and e-liquid products.\n\nSales to Minors Violation\n\nFDA's investigation of the website https://lunar-eciqs.com revealed that you sold an e-liquid product to a minor. Specifically, during our investigation of https://lunar-eciqs.com, a person younger than 18 years of age purchased Caramel Stardust E-Liquid from your website. No retailer may sell covered tobacco products, including e-liquid, cigar, pipe tobacco, waterpipe tobacco, and dissolvable tobacco products, as well as ENDS products that contain any tobacco derivative, to a person younger than 18 years of age under 21 C.F.R. § 1140.14(b). Under 21 C.F.R. § 1140.3, a \"covered tobacco product\" is defined as any tobacco product deemed to be subject to chapter IX of the FD&C Act by 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2, excluding components or parts not made or derived from tobacco. Before 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2 became effective, only cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and cigarette tobacco were subject to chapter IX of the FD&C Act. 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2 deems all other tobacco products, except accessories of such tobacco products, subject to chapter IX and its implementing regulations. The product cited in this violation is a \"covered tobacco product.\" Under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)), tobacco products are misbranded if sold or distributed in violation of regulations prescribed under section 906(d) of the FD&C Act, including those within 21 C.F.R. Part 1140. Because this product is sold or distributed to persons younger than 18 years of age in violation of 21 C.F. R. § 1140.14(b), this product is misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)).\n\nElectronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) and E-Liquid Products with Labeling and/or Advertising that Fail to Include the Required Nicotine Warning Statement are Misbranded\n\nAdditionally, our review of the website https://lunar-ecigs.com revealed that the labeling and/or advertising for the following ENDS and e-liquid products that you advertise and offer for sale or distribution in the United States do not include the required nicotine warning statement: Banana Galaxy Disposable E-Hookah, Big Bang Blueberry Disposable E-Hookah, Cosmic Cherry Disposable E-Hookah, Planet Peach Disposable EHookah, Solar Strawberry Disposable E-Hookah, Venus Vanilla Disposable E-Hookah, Atomic Apple ELiquid, Banana Galaxy E-Liquid, Big Bang Blueberry E-Liquid, Blue Porn Blast E-Liquid, Caramel Stardust ELiquid, Celestial Coffee E-Liquid, Cosmic Cherry E-Liquid, Electric Cola E-Liquid, Galactic Grape E-Liquid, Hubble Bubble Gum E-Liquid, Jet Juicy E-Liquid, Jupiter Whiskey E-Liquid, Luna Colada E-Liquid, Mars Mango E-Liquid, Mercury Menthol E-Liquid, Nuclear Orange E-Liquid, Pineapple Earth E-Liquid, Planet Peach E-Liquid, Quantum Lemon E-Liquid, Solar Strawberry E-Liquid, Strawberry Kiwi Star E-Liquid, Titan Tobacco E-Liquid, Venus Vanilla E-Liquid, and Watermelon Matter E-Liquid. Under 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3, labeling and advertising for cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and covered tobacco products (other than cigars), such as ENDS and e-liquid products, must bear the following warning statement:\n\nWARNING: This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\n\nFor cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and covered tobacco products other than cigars, it is unlawful for any person to manufacture, package, sell, offer to sell, distribute, or import for sale or distribution in the United States such product unless such tobacco product package bears the following required warning statement on the package label: \"WARNING: This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical\" (21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(a)). It also is unlawful for such tobacco product manufacturer, packager, importer, distributor, or retailer of the tobacco product to advertise or cause to be advertised within the United States any tobacco product unless each advertisement bears the required warning statement (21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(b)). Under 21 C.F.R. § 1140.3, a \"covered tobacco product'' is defined as any tobacco product deemed to be subject to the FD&C Act under 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2, excluding components or parts not made or derived from tobacco. Before 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2 became effective, only cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and cigarette tobacco were subject to chapter IX of the FD&C Act. 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2 deems all other tobacco products, except accessories of such tobacco products, subject to chapter IX and its implementing regulations. The products cited in this violation are \"covered tobacco products.\" Under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)), tobacco products are misbranded if sold or distributed in violation of regulations prescribed under section 906(d) of the FD&C Act, including those within 21 C.F.R. Part 1143. Because your website regarding ENDS and e-liquid products does not include the required nicotine warning statement for these products, in violation of 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(a) and/or 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3{b), your ENDS and e-liquid products, are misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)).\n\nIn addition, a tobacco product is misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. A tobacco product is misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(A)) if, in the case of any tobacco product distributed or offered for sale in any state, its advertising is false or misleading in any particular. Under section 201 (n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321 (n)), in determining whether labeling and/or advertising is misleading, the agency considers, among other things, the failure to reveal material facts concerning the consequences that may result from the customary or usual use of the product. Because your website regarding ENDS and e-liquid products does not include the required nicotine warning statement for these products, your ENDS and e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(A)).\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately correct the violations referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any other media in which you advertise comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. Failure to ensure full compliance with the FD&C Act may result in-FDA initiating further action without notice, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, no-tobacco-sale orders, criminal prosecution, seizure, and/or injunction.
