Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body.\n\nThis inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\n\nWe received a response from Dr. Martin Schaich, Managing Director, dated November 25, 2022 concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, which was issued to your firm. We address this response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to adequately document the results of the device software validation, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(g).\n\nFor example, the documentation for the validation of the FANhp/PyloPlus device software revision 1.49 was not adequately documented. Specifically, no documentation of the software revision plan was available, nor was there documentation and approval of the input software specification requirements. Additionally, the verification and validation test plan with acceptance criteria and methods to be used to test the software was not approved prior to starting the testing and the results of the testing were not adequately documented to include the identification of the software version being tested, the test equipment used to conduct the testing and the test results. In addition, your firm also confirmed that there was no documentation available supporting the validation for the change to lower the QC lower limit.\n\nYour response dated November 25, 2022 is not adequate. Your firm opened CAPA 2022-FDA-5 to address this observation. You stated in your response that your firm will perform the following corrective actions:\na. Revise SOP (b)(4) Software Development” and SOP (b)(4) Software Change and Maintenance Process” to comply with applicable regulations\nb. Revise the previous software documentation for FANhp software version 1.49\nc. Train personnel on the new SOPs.\n\nIn addition, to prevent recurrence of the non-conformity, your firm stated in the CAPA they will take preventive actions of “After implementation of the corrective action, all software development projects are checked whether the required documents and records are available and, if necessary, created; incorporating US regulations for software development in the internal audit plan, and training auditors to understand and check for US FDA regulations. Your firm has not yet completed the corrective actions and promised to correct the observation by June 30, 2023. Your response is not adequate because it does not appear that your firm is conducting a systematic and retrospective review to ensure that previous software revisions have been properly validated and documented. Your firm should evaluate all previous software revisions to ensure they have been properly validated and documented in accordance with 21 CFR 820.30(g). In addition, your firm should re-validate the software validation for the FANhp software version 1.49 to ensure that all design inputs and acceptance criteria are met including validation for the change to the QC lower limit.\n\n2. Failure to adequately establish and maintain procedures for corrective and preventive action, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a).\n\nFor example:\na) Your firm's Corrective and Preventive Measures SOP Doc. (b)(4), Revision 2021-01-14 does not include adequate requirements which identify the sources to be analyzed and the statistical methods used to detect recurring non-conformities.\nb) Your firm confirmed that there was no documentation of the root cause investigation for CAPA 2022-13. There was no available documentation of the investigation into the failure using the (b)(4)” as required by your firm’s CAPA procedure.\nc) Your firm’s Form (b)(4) record for CAPA 2022-13 was signed prior to the completion of all corrective actions. In addition, the form appears to only document implementation of the CAPA, and does not appear to require verifying or validating the CAPA to ensure that such action is effective and does not adversely affect the finished device.\n\nYour response dated November 25, 2022 is not adequate. Your firm opened CAPA 2022-FDA-4 to address this observation. You stated in your response that your firm will perform the following corrective actions by April 28, 2023:\na. Revise SOP (b)(4) to insert requirements for sources to be analyzed and statistical methods to detect recurring non-conformities\nb. Development of a procedure/form sheet that all activities and corrective actions are identified and documented\nc. Train employees on the (b)(4) and revised SOP\n\nIn addition, to prevent recurrence of the non-conformity, your firm stated in the CAPA they will take preventive actions of supplementing the audit plan with applicable requirements of 21 CFR and training QM employees to act accordingly to SOPs. You have provided an updated CAPA form which appears to be adequate for documenting CAPA activities such as root cause investigation, the corrective actions needed, and implementation and effectiveness of the corrective actions, but have not completed the other corrective actions. Your response is not adequate because your firm does not appear to be conducting a systematic and retrospective review of sources to be analyzed and the statistical methods used to identify potential recurring quality problems and non-conformities. In addition, your firm does not appear to be conducting a systematic and retrospective review of previous CAPAs to ensure that root cause analysis, corrective action implementation, and effectiveness checks were documented.\n\n3. Failure to adequately establish and maintain procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit, as required by 21 CFR 820.198.\n\nFor example, your firm's SOP-(b)(4) titled Measuring and Data Analysis Doc. ID: (b)(4) Revision: (b)(4) does not include adequate requirements which ensure timely and uniform processing of complaints, nor does the procedure ensure oral complaints are documented upon receipt and that complaints are adequately evaluated as to whether the complaint may be subject to Medical Device Reporting (MDR) requirements. In addition, the procedure does not include requirements to ensure when complaints involve the possible failure of a device to meet any of its specifications that the complaint is reviewed, evaluated, and investigated as required per 21 CFR 820.198(c). Nor does the procedure include requirements which ensure that when an investigation is conducted, a record of the investigation is maintained including the dates and results of the investigations, the corrective actions and any replies to the complainant are recorded in the complaint record, as required per 21 CFR 820.198(e).\n\nYour response dated November 25, 2022 is not adequate. Your firm opened CAPA 2022-FDA-3 to address this observation. You stated in the response that your firm will perform the following corrective actions by February 28, 2023:\na. Revise the complaint process with inclusion of a reporting decision tree\nb. Redefine responsibilities for complaint processing\nc. Implementation of all requirements of EU regulations and 21 CFR 820.198\nd. Re-evaluation of FANhp (PyloPlus) complaint cases since the PMA in 2020\ne. Training of all employees that any feedback that could indicate a quality problem within the company or on the products must be documented and forwarded to the complaint handler. Responsible person and employees of complaint processing are trained in the new complaint process and informed about the subsequent reporting obligation process\n\nIn addition, your firm stated in the CAPA they will take preventive actions by expanding their internal audit to include all aspects of 21 CFR 803, 806, and 820 and regularly assess their compliance. Your firm has provided documentation of an implemented Form complaint processing (Doc-ID: (b)(4), revision: (b)(4)), which includes a MDR decision flow chart and provided records for re-evaluation of 7 of 9 previous FANhp (PyloPlus) complaint cases dating back to the PMA approval in 2020. However, your firm’s implemented form does not appear to include information regarding when investigations are required, and fails to include requirements to report to the FDA when your firm become aware that a device has malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur as required per 21 CFR 803.50(a)(2). In addition, your firm appears to be re-evaluating previous complaints prior to establishing the new complaint procedure that addresses the identified deficiencies in meeting the requirements of 21 CFR 820.198.\n\n4. Failure to validate software used as part of the quality system for its intended use according to an established protocol, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(i).\n\nFor example: the Excel spreadsheets used to record complaint records and Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) activities have not been validated to ensure the records are adequately and accurately recorded. Changes made to the complaint and CAPA records are not retained with identification of the change, the date of the change or the identification of the individual making the change. Additionally, the spreadsheets allow records to be deleted without any records of the deletion, the rationale for the deletion, or the identification of the individual deleting such records.\n\nYour response dated November 25, 2022 is not adequate. Your firm opened CAPA 2022-FDA-2 to address this observation. You stated in your response that your firm will perform the following corrective actions by February 28, 2023:\na. List and evaluate all Excel spreadsheets used in their Quality Management System for correct documentation methods\nb. Search for a suitable method to keep records in conformity with regulations\nc. Update the SOP to include new procedures and requirements for document control\nd. File complaints and CAPA in paper form until further notice\ne. Train employees who work with Excel spreadsheets\n\nYour firm provided updated complaint and CAPA forms. However, your response is not adequate because your firm does not appear to be conducting a systematic and retrospective review of previously documented complaint and CAPA to identify potential gaps between the existing Excel spreadsheet records and any physical records. In addition, your firm has not completed the evaluation of other unvalidated Excel spreadsheets used in their Quality Management Systems to determine if there are other systems impacted or additional corrective action(s) needed.\n\n5. Failure to adequately document equipment inspections, checks and maintenance activities, as required by 21 CFR 820.72(a).\n\nFor example, no documentation was available for the inspection, check or maintenance activities of (b)(4) used in assessment of the pumps during the production and repair of FANhp and PyloPlus devices.\n\nYour response dated November 25, 2022 is not adequate. Your firm opened CAPA 2022-FDA-7 to address this observation. You stated in your response that your firm will perform the following corrective actions by April 28, 2023:\na. Revise SOP (b)(4) “Monitoring of the measuring equipment”, and corresponding form for recording of test equipment, to meet requirements of EU regulations and 21 CFR 820.72\nb. Train inspectors and employees responsible for test equipment on the revised process and form\n\nIn addition, to prevent recurrence of the non-conformity, your firm stated in the CAPA that you will take preventive actions of expanding the internal audit plan to include 21 CFR 803, 806, 820 requirements and regularly assessing compliance and training auditors to understand and audit the requirements of 21 CFR 803, 806, and 820. Your firm has not yet completed nor implemented the corrective actions. Your response is not adequate because your firm does not appear to be conducting a retrospective, systemic evaluation of all inspection, measuring, and test equipment to ensure they are suitable for their intended purposes and are capable of producing valid results.\n\nOur inspection also revealed that your firm’s PyloPlus UBT System 13/12CO2 breathing gas analyzers devices are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 - Medical Device Reporting. Significant violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nFailure to adequately develop, maintain, and implement written MDR procedures as required by 21 CFR 803.17.\n\nFor example, during the inspection, your firm identified the document titled “SOP (b)(4) Alarm and Recall Regulation Medical Devices”, Doc. ID: (b)(4) Alarm, Revision: (b)(4), as its MDR procedure. However, after reviewing the MDR procedure, the following deficiencies were noted:\n\n1. The procedure does not establish internal systems that provide for timely and effective identification, communication, and evaluation of events that may be subject to MDR requirements, as required by 21 CFR 803.17(a)(1). For example:\n\na. There are no definitions of what your firm will consider to be a reportable event under 21 CFR Part 803. The exclusion of definitions from 21 CFR 803.3 for the terms “become aware,” “caused or contributed,” “malfunction,” “MDR reportable event,” and “serious injury,” and the definition for the term “reasonably suggests” found in 803.20(c)(1) may lead your firm to make an incorrect reportability decision when evaluating a complaint that may meet the criteria for reporting under 21 CFR 803.50(a).\nb. The procedure, as written, combines language from the requirements of other regulatory or competent authorities with the requirements in 21 CFR Part 803 in a manner that will result in incomplete, inadequate, or even non-reporting of adverse events that meet the reportability requirements under 21 CFR Part 803.\nc. The procedure does not include instructions for how your firm will evaluate information about an event to make MDR reportability determination in a timely manner.\n\n2. The procedure does not establish internal systems that provide for timely transmission of complete medical device reports, as required by 21 CFR 803.17(a)(3). Specifically, the procedure does not include:\n\na. Instructions for how to obtain and complete the FDA 3500A form.\nb. The circumstances under which your firm must submit initial 30 days, supplemental or follow-up, 5-day report and the requirements for such reports.\nc. A process for submitting MDRs electronically in accordance with 21 CFR 803.20(a)(3).\nd. How your firm will ensure that all information reasonably known to you is submitted for each event. Specifically, which sections of the Form 3500A will need to be completed to include all information found in your firm’s possession and any information that becomes available as a result of a reasonable follow up within your firm.\n\n3. The procedure does not describe how your firm will address documentation and recordkeeping requirements, as required by 21 CFR 803.17(b), including:\n\na. Documentation of adverse event related information maintained as MDR event files.\nb. Information that was evaluated to determine if an event was reportable.\nc. Documentation of the deliberations and decision-making processes used to determine if a device-related death, serious injury, or malfunction was or was not reportable, as required under 21 CFR 803.18(b)(1)(i).\nd. Systems that ensure access to information that facilitates timely follow-up and inspection by FDA.\n\nYour firm’s response dated November 25, 2022, is not adequate. Your firm opened a CAPA (2022-FDA-1, dated 11-22-2022) to address the noted deficiencies. Your response noted that your firm planned to revise its MDR procedure. However, the response did not address all the procedure deficiencies noted above. Specifically, deficiencies 1.b, 1.c., 3.a, 3.b and 3.c. In addition, it did not include evidence of implementation.\n\nOther federal agencies may take your compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementation regulations into account when considering the award of federal contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been addressed.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to address the noted violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective action (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Please provide a translation of documentation not in English to facilitate our review. We will notify you regarding the adequacy of your firm’s response(s) and the need to re-inspect your firm’s facility to verify that the appropriate corrections and/or corrective actions have been made. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration as part of your response.\n\nYour firm’s response should be sent via email to CDRHWarningLetterResponses@fda.hhs.gov or by mail to Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Office of Regulatory Programs, Division of Regulatory Programs 2, FDA Regulatory Inspections and Audits Team, White Oak Building 66, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993.
