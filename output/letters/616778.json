CCII from chicken sternal cartilage was shown to reduce chronic joint inflammation . . .”\n  − “A three-month study recruited 60 patients with chronic joint inflammation to take CCII or a placebo. Results indicated CCII alleviated swollen and tender joints in the treatment group. Four patients in the treatment group had a complete remission of chronic joint inflammation.”\n  − “Similarly, a pilot-study recruited female subjects with joint pain to take Hydrolyzed Collagen Type II for 42 days. Subjects reported a significant improvement in joint mobility and decrease in joint pain and stiffness.”\n  − “CCII is evidenced to be effective among adolescents with chronic joint inflammation. A pilot-study administered CCII to 10 adolescent patients with chronic joint inflammation for 12 weeks. Eight patients experienced a reduction in swollen and tender joints. A similar pilot-study recruited nine adolescents with chronic joint inflammation to take an oral Collagen Type II, finding the supplement . . . reduced joint inflammation.”\n  − “Chondroitin Sulfate (Component of Collagen Type II) [an ingredient in CellRenewPRO and CellRenewSTS] Naturally found in sternal chicken Collagen Type II, chondroitin sulfate has anti-inflammatory activity that reduces joint swelling, maintains synovial fluid levels, and spacing between the joints. Further, chondroitin sulfate reduces the proliferation of proteins to reduce joint inflammation.”\n  − “A one-year study recruited 42 patients with knee pain to take chondroitin sulfate or a placebo. Subjects taking chondroitin sulfate had greater joint mobility and less pain, when compared to the placebo group.”\n  − “A three-month study recruited 110 patients with knee pain to take chondroitin sulfate or a placebo finding supplementation improved knee function, reduced pain, and maintained joint space in the knee.”\n  − “Researchers suggested chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine could repair and regenerate cartilage . . .”\n  − “Hyaluronic Acid (Component of Collagen Type II) [an ingredient in CellRenewPRO and CellRenewSTS] . . . Studies have suggested hyaluronic acid has anti-inflammatory activity that suppresses pro-inflammatory and pain mechanisms in the body.”\n  − “Researchers found that HA inhibited inflammatory cytokine activity in mice with inflamed joints. A similar study reviewed the effect of HA on acute and chronic inflammation in rats, finding HA suppressed inflammatory reactions . . .”\n\nOn the homepage for the https://appliedhealth.com website:\n\n• “How do you help knee pain? . . . CellRenew PRO is Extreme Knee Protection”\n\n• “CellRenew Additional Links . . . CellRenew Collagen Type II and Knee Pain . . .

The results of a human clinical trial using this material showed significant improvements in the reduction of joint swelling, tenderness, and pain, as well as successful increases in mobility.”\n\n• In the response to the question “Who is a good candidate to take CellRenew?”:\n\n  − “Although studies have shown that many different conditions respond to Collagen Type II, the conditions that have shown the greatest response are rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. If you have grown weary of traditional protocols that only cover-up symptoms and neglect to address the root cause, then you are an excellent candidate to begin a program of Collagen Type II.”\n  − “CellRenew is also used as a preventative measure for athletes who . . . are looking for a way to maintain healthy joints prior to the onset of osteoarthritis.”\n\n• In response to the question “What will it do for me?”:\n\n  − “Collagen Type II (CTII) [an ingredient in CellRenewPRO and CellRenewSTS] has been suggested to offer significant benefits for some types of arthritis. . . . Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most well known of the autoimmune types of arthritis. In the case of RA, the collagen in the joints is attacked.”\n  − “Depending on the particular type of arthritis you experience, CTII goes to work in different ways. If you suffer from RA, CTII acts as an oral tolerization agent, instructing the body to stop the immune response to the collagen in the joints. . . . For those suffering from osteoarthritis, CTII provides the critical building blocks that restore a healthy state to the cartilage in the joints.”\n  − “CellRenew is made from chicken sternal cartilage that contains the highest level of naturally occurring anti-inflammatory proteoglycans (Hyaluronic Acid and Chondroitin Sulfate A) of any other material tested, including shark cartilage. It is important to note that the combination of the proteoglycans and the Collagen Type II proteins . . . provide the building blocks required to rebuild lost cartilage to restore the joint to a normal state.”\n\n• In response to the question “What do the studies show?”:\n\n  − “The results of a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial has proved the benefits of Collagen Type II for treating the symptoms of pain and immobility associated with arthritis. . . . report an 89.9% positive response rate, within 45 days, for the participants who consumed at least 2000 mg of Collagen Type II per day.”\n  − “[R]eported having successfully treated more than 50 patients, starting in 1974, with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and many other ailments. . . .”\n  − “Of the different types of cartilage tested, the one with the highest level of Collagen Type II, anti-inflammatory proteoglycans (the healing properties) was chicken sternal cartilage. CellRenew is 100% chicken sternal cartilage.”\n\n• In response to the question “What else is it good for?”:\n\n  − “Besides the better-known associations with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, it has also been suggested that Collagen Type II might benefit heart disease, psoriasis, progressive myopia, and some other autoimmune diseases.”\n\n• In response to the question “How long before I improve?”:  \n\n  − “Although some people have noticed an improvement with their symptoms after only a week or two of starting a CellRenew program, many take between 4 and 6 weeks. . . . some forms of arthritis symptoms tend to respond faster – on average – than other forms. For instance, we do know that rheumatoid arthritis sufferers have a tendency to respond faster . . .”\n\nUnder the heading “CellRenew Customer Stories” on the homepage for the https://appliedhealth.com website:\n\n• “‘I have been taking CellRenew since May of 2003. . . . This product has kept my arthritis at bay. . . .’”\n\n• “‘[T]hank you for the dramatic results I have experienced in the first three weeks of taking CellRenew. For the past twenty years, I have been living with severe lower back pain. I was diagnosed with a degenerative disc disorder in the L2, L3, and L4 vertebrae. . . . CellRenew has improved my quality of life one thousand percent.’”\n\n• “‘Fourteen months ago – diagnosed with scoliosis, osteoarthritis of the spine and degenerative disc disease – my active life was gone . . . I was in excruciating pain most of the time. . . . On the xray [sic], my spine looked like a rock pile. . . . Enter CellRenew, and within one month, the improvement was incredible. That was four months ago. . . . I have my life back. I know that CellRenew works!’”\n\n• “‘I wanted to tell you all about how thrilled I am with CellRenew. I have been taking CellRenew for just over a year now. I have not had a single ache or pain in at least 10 months. I have experienced no side effects, except for one good side effect. I have changed my eyeglass prescription, twice! Both times were for the better! My eyesight is improving. . . .’”\n\nUnder the heading “In the beginning…” on the homepage for the https://appliedhealth.com website:\n\n• “Bill Evans, President, Applied Health . . . my lifestyle was finally catching up to me . . . due to rapidly progressing arthritis. . . . Instead of a future filled with the pursuit of my favorite activities, and dreams of conquering the Bucket List, I only saw the prospect of surgeries, painkillers, and physical therapy. I decided there had to be a better way than knee replacement and a cocktail of medications. A year later, in 1997, we started Applied Health and introduced our first Collagen-based, joint support product using hydrolyzed collagen type II . . . We called it CellRenew, and over 20 years later, we still have devoted users . . .

This product has changed my life significantly.’”\n\nOn the “Is Collagen Type II A Cure For Arthritis And Heart Disease?” webpage (https://appliedhealth.com/cellrenew-collagen-type-ii/collagen-type-ii-cure-arthritis-heart-disease/), which hyperlinks to the online storefront where the CellRenewPRO and CellRenewSTS products can be purchased:\n\n• Under the heading “Collagen Type II [an ingredient in CellRenewPRO and CellRenewSTS] and Arthritis”:\n\n  − “. . . 50 million Americans suffer from some form of arthritis, either rheumatoid or osteoarthritis, as well as a variety of other arthritic conditions. . . . Could it be that one nutritional medicine called collagen type II can ameliorate both disorders in an effective way?”\n  − “It may turn out that the natural components of cartilage hold the greatest promise of ameliorating both arthritis and heart disease.”\n  − “If collagen type II is derived from chicken sternal cartilage, from chicks six to eight weeks old, it contains the greatest number of anti-inflammatory and joint supporting proteoglycans. These proteoglycans include glucosamine sulfate which has over 30 years of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies indicating that it actually helps to rebuild the cartilage in arthritis joints.”\n  − “[I]t contains a high concentration of chondroitin sulfate A, which is a powerful anti-inflammatory . . .”\n  − “[C]ollagen type II also contains a powerful, newly discovered antioxidant proteoglycan called cartilage matrix glycoprotein (CMGP), which can help reduce the oxidative damage to the joint.”\n  − “When people suffer from arthritis, there is a selective destruction of collagen type II in the joint cartilage itself. Scientists know that this particular component of cartilage is being attacked by white blood cells and somehow this activates the immune system in the rheumatoid arthritic patient to develop antibodies to collagen type II. This then sets up an immune response to all of the cartilage that is degenerating in the body. Thus, both wrists hurt, both knees hurt, the hips, the back, etc.”\n  − “The question now becomes how does collagen type II turn off the immune system in the rheumatoid arthritic. The answer is that collagen type II’s effectiveness is accomplished through ‘oral tolerance.’”\n  − “. . . investigate the side effects of chicken sternal collagen type II being fed to arthritic rats. . . . By the second or third months the rats no longer displayed any symptoms of arthritis. There was a profound amelioration of the disease.”\n  − “. . . studied ten people with severe rheumatoid arthritis. They eliminated the standard therapies such as NSAIDS and methotrexate and fed the patients pure collagen type II derived from chicken sternal cartilage. At the end of the second month, six of the ten patients showed substantial improvement and one showed a complete regression of the disease that lasted 26 months with no side effects.”\n  − “. . . conducted a phase II trial on 59 patients with, again, severe active rheumatoid arthritis. . . . What is interesting is that those who were off all drugs and taking collagen type II showed very significant stabilization and improvement, while those on placebos continued to deteriorate. In fact, four collagen type II patients showed a complete resolution of the disease . . .”\n  − “We see that oral ingestion of collagen type II may well prove to be the most effective natural means of arthritis management regardless of the form of the disease.”\n  − “. . . this is precisely why it works in osteoarthritis . . . collagen type II has such a high concentration of glucosamine and chondroitin . . .”\n  − “In lieu [sic] of the fact that there are no side effects with collagen type II, this would seem to be the product of choice when suffering from any form of arthritic condition.”\n  − “. . . collagen II components are truly chondro-protective agents because they . . . reprogram destructive chondrocytes and cytokines, reducing inflammation . . . protect the surface of the cartilage from oxidative damage . . . act as a powerful anti-inflammatory and pain modulator.”\n\n• Under the heading “Collagen Type II [an ingredient in CellRenewPRO and CellRenewSTS] and Heart Disease”:\n\n  − “Medicines such as aspirin and NSAIDS, as well as natural therapeutics such as fish liver oil or antiarthritic herbs, cannot compete with the overall biochemical power of collagen type II.”\n  − “. . . collagen type II is 14.2 percent chondroitin sulfate A. . . . Chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) has a powerful antithrombogenic or anticoagulant affect, which, in essence, prevents blood clots and has been shown to reduce the incidence of stroke.”\n  − “. . . CSA literally reduced the cholesterol and other lipids in the blood and actually ‘cleared’ cholesterol from the lining of arteries, including the aorta.”\n  − “This indicates a 600 percent reduction in the incidence of fatal heart attacks simply by taking oral CSA on a daily basis . . .”\n  − “Collagen type II has also found some support in the research for the amelioration of autoimmune disease caused by breast implant poisoning, as well as amelioration of Menier’s [sic] disease and progressive myopia.”\n\nOn the “The Village of Long Life” webpage (https://appliedhealth.com/cellrenew-collagen-type-ii/hyaluronic-acid-abc-news/), which hyperlinks to the online storefront where the CellRenewPRO and CellRenewSTS products can be purchased:\n\n• “. . . hyaluronic acid [a component of the Hydrolyzed Collagen II ingredient in the CellRenewPRO and CellRenewSTS products] has been used for years in eye surgery as a shock absorber to protect the retina, and has been proven effective in lubricating arthritic joints.”\n\n• “But HA has been shown to have wound-healing and tissue-reconstruction applications . . .”\n\nOn the “Collagen Type II for Arthritis Pain Relief” blog post (https://appliedhealth.com/collagen-type-ii-for-arthritis-pain-relief/):\n\n• “Collagen Type II [an ingredient in the CellRenewPRO and CellRenewSTS products] for Arthritis Pain Relief”\n\n• “Does Collagen Type II relieve osteoarthritis?
