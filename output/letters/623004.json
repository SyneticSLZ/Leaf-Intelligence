Chung\nPresident\nGlobal LC Inc DBA Rice Chicken\n\n13219 Black Mountain Rd. #7\nSan Diego, CA 92129\nUnited States\n\nIssuing Office:\nDivision of Southwest Imports\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\n\nFebruary 4, 2022\n\nRe: CMS # 623004\n\nDear Mr. Chung,\n\nOn November 3 through November 16, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of your firm Global LC Inc DBA Rice Chicken, located at 13219 Black Mountain Rd. #7, San Diego, CA 92129. We also conducted an inspection on October 24 through November 5, 2019. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1 subpart L.\n\nThe FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food they import into the United States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links in FDAâ€™s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals.\n\nDuring the most recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1 subpart L for the food products you import, including batter mix from (b)(4), and mild taste marinade and roasted seasoning from (b)(4). You did not have FSVPs for these food products or for any products you import. Because of this significant violation, you are not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act.\n\nAt the conclusion of the initial FSVP inspection on November 5, 2019 and the current inspection on November 16, 2021, our investigator provided you with Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations.\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your response dated November 18, 2021 in which you stated that you planned to begin formulating an FSVP for your firm. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide a timeline to start the program and did not provide any supporting documentation or records demonstrating your planned or completed corrective actions.\n\nYour significant violation of the FSVP regulation are as follows:\n\nYou did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 1.502(a). Specifically, your firm did not develop an FSVP for any of the foods you import, including each of the following:\n\na. Batter mix imported from (b)(4) located in (b)(4)\nb. Yang Neum sauce (Mild taste marinade) and roasted seasoning imported from (b)(4) located in (b)(4)\n\nThe above violations are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1 subpart L.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. If you do not adequately address this matter, we may take further action. For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food you import which appear to be in violation of section 805. We may place these foods you import into the United States on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the products. You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert #99-41 at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for importation into the United States of an article of food without the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)).\n\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should address the specific things you are doing to correct any violations. You should include in your response documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a copy of your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), and any additional information that you wish to supply relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you believe that you are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 working days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations.\n\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Ernesto Barba, Compliance Officer, Division of Southwest Imports, 1201 Main Street, Suite 7200, Dallas, TX 75202. If you have any questions regarding this any letter, you may contact Compliance Officer Ernesto Barba via email at Ernesto.Barba@fda.hhs.gov.
