Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including eliquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)).\n\nFDA has determined that several e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)) because your website advertising several e-liquid products fails to include the required nicotine warning statement.\n\nE-Liquid Products with Advertising that Fails to Include the Required Nicotine Warning Statement are Misbranded\n\nOur review of the website https://hotjuice.com revealed that the advertising for several e-liquid products that you manufacture, package, import, distribute, or retail in the United States does not include the required nicotine warning statement in the manner required by 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(b), for example: Hot Juice – Bananaberry Tropicburst Vape Juice, Hot Juice – Bacon Bits Vape Juice, Hot Juice – BAM BAM Crunch Vape Juice, Hot Juice – Banana Eclair Vape Juice, and Hot Juice – Blueberry Cotton Candy Vape Juice. Under 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(b), advertising for cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and covered tobacco products (other than cigars), such as e-liquid products, must bear the following warning statement:\n\nWARNING: This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\n\nFor cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and covered tobacco products (other than cigars), it is unlawful for any tobacco product manufacturer, packager, importer, distributor, or retailer of the tobacco product to advertise or cause to be advertised within the United States any tobacco product unless each advertisement bears the required warning statement (21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(b)(1)). Further, the required warning statement must meet the requirements of 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(b)(2). Under 21 C.F.R. § 1143.1, a “covered tobacco product” is defined as any tobacco product deemed to be subject to the FD&C Act under 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2, excluding components or parts not made or derived from tobacco. Before 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2 became effective, only cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and cigarette tobacco were subject to chapter IX of the FD&C Act. 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2 deems all other tobacco products, except accessories of such tobacco products, subject to chapter IX and its implementing regulations. The products cited in this violation are “covered tobacco products.”\n\nUnder section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)), tobacco products are misbranded if sold or distributed in violation of regulations prescribed under section 906(d) of the FD&C Act, including those within 21 C.F.R. Part 1143. Because your website regarding e-liquid products does not include the required nicotine warning statement for these products, in violation of 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(b), your e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)).\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nThe violation discussed in this letter does not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately correct the violation that is referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the one stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any other media in which you advertise comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may result in FDA taking regulatory action. Please note that any adulterated and misbranded tobacco products offered for import into the United States are subject to detention and refusal of admission.\n\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your corrective actions, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
