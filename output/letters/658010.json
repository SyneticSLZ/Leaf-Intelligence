Your website states, “Tesla BioHealing OTC Medical Devices create their own environments of pure Life Force Energy, offering a much higher concentration of this natural healing force than is available in everyday environments” and “Once the body is given enough Life Force Energy to work with, cellular self-repair mechanisms can begin to activate much faster and more profoundly than previously was possible.” Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, the devices are marketed with indications that these devices activate cellular self-repair mechanisms to treat a wide variety of chronic illnesses and diseases, such as terminal cancers, stroke paralysis, Lyme Disease, Alzheimer’s/Dementia, and Epilepsy.\n\nOur inspection revealed that the Tesla MedBed Generator and Tesla BioHealer medical devices are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). The device is also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm introduced or delivered for introduction this device into interstate commerce for commercial distribution this device, intended for a use different from the intended use of a legally marketed device in the generic type of device described at 21 CFR 890.5500 Infrared lamp without submitting a premarket notification to FDA as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), and 21 CFR 807.81(b).\n\nDevices classified under 21 CFR 890.5500 Infrared lamp are exempt from premarket notification unless they exceed the limitations of exemption at 21 CFR 890.9. However, there is evidence that the Tesla MedBed Generator and Tesla BioHealer devices are intended for uses that are different from those of legally marketed devices classified under 21 CFR 890.5500 Infrared lamp. Generic devices of this type are intended for infrared and therapeutic heating. However, the Tesla MedBed Generator and Tesla BioHealer medical devices do not have a heating element and are marketed for different intended uses, including treatment of a wide variety of chronic illnesses and diseases, such as terminal cancers, stroke paralysis, Lyme Disease, Alzheimer’s/Dementia, and Epilepsy. Examples include:\n\n1. Your “Intended Use Chart,” which was provided to affiliate members (authorized advertisers) of your firm and is available on your company website, www.teslabiohealing.com, contains intended use statements and indications that include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\na. “Severe Conditions Terminal Cancers, Stroke-Paralysis, Intense Chronic Debilitating Pain, Gout, Arthritis, Traumatic Brain Injury, etc.”, “Stroke Paralysis – Place 1 MedBed Generator under paralyzed side of the body and the other Generator under the brain”, “Debilitating Pain – Place 2 Generators as close to affected body part as possible”, “As close to device as possible. Preferably right next to targeted body part. Example: for Terminal Cancers hold or place devices next to areas most affected by cancerous tissue”.\n\nb. “Moderate Conditions Lyme Disease, COPD, Localized Injury, Back Pain, Alzheimer’s/Dementia, Epilepsy/Seizure Disorders, Erectile Dysfunction, Infertility (male & female), etc.”, “As close to device as possible. Preferably right next to targeted body part. Example: for COPD hold device next to lungs or place device close to lungs”.\n\nc. “Mild Conditions Asthma, High Blood Sugar, High Blood Pressure, Mild Muscle/Nerve Pain, Sleep Problems, ADHD, Autism, etc.”\n\nd. “For Children 6-18 yrs”, “Type 1 Diabetes, Headaches, ADHD, Autism, etc.”, “1 Child BioHealer for young children 6-12 years old”, “2 Child BioHealers for children 13-18 years old”.\n\n2. Your company website, www.teslabiohealing.com contains additional intended uses and disease claims, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\na. “Based on the trends we have seen with over 20,000 people using Tesla BioHealing technology to date, many early signs of efficacy have been known to take place as more Life Force Energy is offered to the body...\nLife Force Energy Early Signs of Efficacy:\n Pain Reduction\n Better Sleep\n Vivid Dreams (a sign of enhanced brain activity)\n Increased Vitality\n Increased Libido\n Improved Digestion\n Easier Breathing\n Increased Mental Clarity\n Normalized Glucose Levels\n Normalized Blood Pressure Levels...”\n\nb. “In addition to these early signs of efficacy, it is likely you will also note rapid improvements that are specific to your condition.

Known Benefits of Life Force Energy:\n Promotes natural healing and cellular self-repair\n Helps reduce or eliminate pain\n Increases ATP levels, reducing fatigue and boosting vitality\n Increases cellular energy up to the optimal range of (b)(4)\n Generates stem cells naturally\n Promotes blood circulation\n Reduces Inflammation\n Strengthens immune system\n Improves mental clarity and focus\n Improves quality of sleep...”\n\n4. The Tesla BioHealer for Adults finished product label contains the following intended use statement:\na. “Indication:\n Reduce pain\n Promote blood circulation with Natural Life Force Energy...”\n\n5. The Tesla BioHealer for Children finished product label contains the following intended use statement: “This FDA registered over-the-counter (OTC) medical device to improve blood circulation and relieve pain”.\n\n6. The Tesla BioHealing BioHealer Alpha finished product label contains the following intended use statement: “[Indication] Tesla BioHealing® BioHealer Alpha generates a biophoton field to energize brain and other organs of the body to increase energy, reduce pain, improve blood circulation, and improve life quality of the user”.\n\n7. The Tesla BioHealing BioHealer Plus finished product label contains the following intended use statement: “[Indication] Tesla BioHealing® BioHealer Plus generates a biophoton field to energize brain and other organs of the body to increase energy, reduce pain, improve blood circulation, and improve life quality of the user”.\n\n8. Promotional brochures for the family of Tesla BioHealing devices contain intended use statements and disease claims including, but not limited to, the following:\n\na. “Tesla BioHealing products are FDA Registered Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medical Devices aimed at addressing pain and inflammation in people with unmet needs such as Stroke Paralysis, Dementia, Alzheimer’s, Terminal Cancers, Diabetic Neuropathy, and Rare Diseases. The Life Force Energy generated by our devices has been proven to help even those who have no available effective therapies”.\n\nb. “Known Benefits of Life Force Energy:\n Promotes natural healing and cellular self-repair.\n Helps reduce or eliminate pain.\n Increases ATP levels, reducing fatigue and boosting vitality.\n Increases cellular energy up to the optimal range of (b)(4).\n Generates stem cells naturally.\n Promotes blood circulation.\n Reduces inflammation.\n Strengthens immune system.\n Improves mental clarity and focus.\n Improves quality of sleep...”\n\nBecause there is evidence that the Tesla MedBed Generator and Tesla BioHealer medical devices are intended for uses that are different from those of legally marketed devices classified under 21 CFR 890.5500, it exceeds the limitations described in 21 CFR 890.9(a) and is not exempt from premarket notification.\n\nThis inspection also revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\n\nWe received responses from you dated, 03/27/2023, 04/03/2023, and 04/06/2023, concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, that was issued to your firm. We address these responses below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for validating the device design and failure to ensure that devices conform to defined user needs and intended uses, as required by 21 CFR § 820.30(g).\n\nSpecifically, your design validation procedure titled, “Design Validation, DV-2022, SOP-DV-2022” has not been implemented and no further documentation of design validation or design control activities was maintained. Furthermore, you have not ensured that your devices conform to defined user needs and intended uses.\n\nWe reviewed your firm responses and conclude that they are not adequate. Your responses do not address the establishment or implementation of design validation or design control procedures. Additionally, your responses indicate that unsupported intended use and indication statements have been removed from website content, although such unsupported claims were observed during a review of your company website on 04/28/2023.\n\n2. Failure to establish quality system procedures and instructions, as required by 21 CFR § 820.20(e).\n\nSpecifically, the inspection revealed that you have written, but not implemented, required quality system procedures. For example, you developed, but have not implemented the following procedures and forms:\n\na. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit, as required by 21 CFR § 820.198(a). You developed complaint handling procedures titled, “Customer Servicing SOP-2022-1121 SOP-Customer-Serving\" but have not implemented this procedure.\n\nb. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action, as required by 21 CFR § 820.100(a). You developed corrective and preventive action procedures titled, “Corrective and Preventive Action 2022-1067 Corrective-Preventive Action” but have not implemented this procedure.\n\nc. Failure to develop, conduct, control, and monitor production processes to ensure that your devices conform to specifications, as required by 21 CFR § 820.70(a). You developed production and process control procedures titled, “In-Process Inspection SOP-2022-1062 SOP-In-Process Inspection” but have not implemented this procedure.\n\nd. Failure to establish and maintain procedures to control product that does not conform to specified requirements and that address the identification, documentation, evaluation, segregation, and disposition of nonconforming product, as required by 21 CFR § 820.90(a). You developed nonconforming product procedures titled, “Non-Conformance Record Rev. No. 2” but have not implemented this procedure.\n\nWe reviewed your firm responses and conclude that they are not adequate. Your responses do not address or document the establishment or implementation of any quality system procedures.\n\n3. Failure to establish and maintain an adequate organizational structure to ensure that devices are designed and produced in accordance with the requirements of the Quality System Regulation, as required by 21 CFR § 820.20(b).\n\nSpecifically, you have not appointed a management representative, nor have you assured that quality system procedures have been implemented and supporting documentation to demonstrate quality system activities are being completed.\n\nWe reviewed your firm responses and conclude that they are not adequate. Your response, dated 03/27/2023, indicated that your employee, previously employed as your firm’s Human Resource Manager, is now employed as your QA/QC Manager, and included an updated organizational chart. Alternatively, you provided no evidence to demonstrate that this employee has any quality or regulatory knowledge, experience, or training.\n\n4. Failure to ensure that all inspection, measuring, and test equipment, including mechanical, automated, or electronic inspection and test equipment, is suitable for its intended purposes and is capable of producing valid results, as required by 21 CFR § 820.72(a).\n\nSpecifically, you have provided no valid or scientific rationale, technical specifications, or mechanical explanation of the Bovis Life Force Bioenergy Units Dowsing Chart, or processing equipment, used to manufacture and inspect your in-process or finished devices. You have not demonstrated the validity of the Bovis Life Force Bioenergy Units Dowsing Chart, accompanying processing equipment, nor have you documented that it is capable of producing valid results.\n\nWe reviewed your firm responses and conclude that they are not adequate. Your response, dated 03/27/2023, indicated that you plan to establish a process for verifying equipment is capable of producing valid results, but no specific corrective action plan or planned timeframe was provided. Your response, dated 04/06/2023, documented that you have ordered or purchased “biophotonic imaging cameras” but no valid, scientific data was provided to support this equipment is capable of producing valid results.\n\n5. Failure to establish and maintain the requirements, including quality requirements, that must be met by suppliers, contractors, and consultants, and the failure to evaluate and select potential suppliers, contractors, and consultants on the basis of their ability to meet specified requirements, including quality requirements, as required by 21 CFR § 820.50.\n\nSpecifically, you have no established or implemented purchasing control procedures. Furthermore, you have not evaluated suppliers, defined the type and extent of control to be exercised over the product and suppliers, established, or maintained records of acceptable suppliers, nor have you established data that clearly describe the specified requirements, including quality requirements, for purchased products.\n\nWe reviewed your firm responses and conclude that they are not adequate. Your responses indicate you have assigned an employee to document purchasing controls, but no documented evidence of such activities being performed was provided. Additionally, no documentation of the establishment or implementation of purchasing control procedures was provided.\n\nUnder section 510 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360), manufacturers of medical devices are required to annually register with the FDA. In September 2007, section 510 of the Act was amended by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-85) to require domestic and foreign device establishments to submit their annual establishment registration and device listing information to FDA by electronic means [section 510(p) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360(p))] during the period beginning October 1st and ending December 31st of each year. Our records indicate that your firm has not fulfilled annual registration and listing requirements for fiscal year 2023.\n\nYour firm has not listed the proprietary names “Tesla MedBed Generators and Tesla BioHealers” on any of your Registration and Listing Information provided to the FDA and your firm does not appear to have the required 510(k) for these devices. Therefore, all of your firm’s devices are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(o) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(0)), in that the devices were not included in a list required by section 510(j) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360(j)).\n\nYour firm should take prompt action to address any violations identified in this letter. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties.\n\nOther federal agencies may take your compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations into account when considering the award of federal contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been addressed. Should FDA determine that your devices or facilities do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to address the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address any violations included in this Warning Letter. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration as part of your response.\n\nYour firm’s response should be sent to: Gina Brackett, Director of Compliance Branch, at oradevices1firmresponse@fda.hhs.gov. Refer to CMS # 658010 when replying. If you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Katelyn Staub-Zamperini, Compliance Officer, at (412) 644-3394 ext. 20 or katelyn.staub-zamperini@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems.
