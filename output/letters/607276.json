Hotze, MD\n                           Health & Wellness Center International One, L.L.C. dba Hotze Vitamins\n                           20214 Braidwood, Ste. 215\n                           Katy, Texas 77450\n                 \n\nRE: Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n\n \n\nThis is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses www.hotzehwc.com and www.hotzevitamins.com on September 10, 2020 and November 3, 2020, respectively. We also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/Hotze-HWC/, www.facebook.com/MyHotzeVitamins/, www.twitter.com/hotzehealth.com, and www.twitter.com/HotzeVitamins/, where you direct consumers to your website www.hotzevitamins.com to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that your website www.hotzevitamins.com offers the products “Dr. Hotze’s Immune Pak with Vitamins A, B, C, D, Zinc and Probiotics” (sometimes referred to on your websites as “Dr. Hotze’s Immune Pak” or “Dr. Hotze’s Immune Pak for Adults”), “Dr. Hotze’s Kids Immune Pak,” and “Dr. Hotze’s Teen Immune Pak” for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19  in people. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).\n\nThere is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.  In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.  Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.\n\nSome examples of the claims on your websites that establish the intended use of your products, including based on statements about the purported effects of their ingredients,  and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:\n\nOn your Hotze Vitamins website [www.hotzevitamins.com]:\n\nYour blog post titled, “BACK TO SCHOOL: NEW KIDS AND TEEN IMMUNE PAKS” at https://www.hotzevitamins.com/Back-to-School-NEW-Kids-and-Teen-Immune-Paks_b_16.html displays images of your products “Dr. Hotze’s Kids Immune Pak,” “Dr. Hotze’s Teen Immune Pak,” and “Dr. Hotze’s Immune Pak with Vitamins A, B, C, D, Zinc and Probiotics” and includes the following claims:\n\n• “The time to start boosting their immune system is now . . . because of the coronavirus . . . Another way to help boost their immune system is with quality vitamins, minerals and probiotics. Take a look at the many health benefits of these supplements:”\n\n\no “Vitamin B6 has been implicated in the regulation of immune responses that are associated with a wide range of diseases, including inflammation ….”\n\no “Research demonstrates that probiotics are safe and effective for fighting the common cold and influenza-like respiratory infections….”\n\n \nOn your Hotze HWC website, www.hotzehwc.com, which directs consumers to your website www.hotzevitamins.com to purchase your products:\n\nFrom your May 26, 2020, blog post titled, “Dr. Erika Schwartz on The Immune System and Coronavirus” at https://www.hotzehwc.com/2020/05/dr-erika-schwartz-on-the-immune-system-and-coronavirus/, which provides a transcript of Dr. Steven Hotze’s interview with Dr. Erika Schwartz and attributes the following statements to Dr. Hotze:\n\n• “Dr. Hotze: . . . I was on Fox News on March the 15th, Sunday afternoon, on the coronavirus pandemic report. . . And I talked about the importance of vitamin A, B, C, D and Z with the probiotic, and I made my case and said, ‘Build up your immune system that’s what you need to do. If you have a healthy immune system, you’re not going to have to worry about this virus or that virus or this bacterial infection, you’re going to be healthy. And that’s what you can do and you need to do that now through . . . the vitamins you take . . .’ I mean, the lady looked at me and she goes, ‘We don’t really believe vitamins and all those things can help you with the coronavirus.’ Well of course it can.”\n\n\nOn your Hotze Vitamins Facebook social media website [www.facebook.com/MyHotzeVitamins/] and your Hotze Health HWC Facebook social media website [www.facebook.com/Hotze-HWC/]:\n\nIn a July 28, 2020, post, you display graphics of your Dr. Hotze’s Kids Immune Pak and Dr. Hotze’s Teen Immune Pak products, direct consumers to your website www.hotzevitamins.com to purchase these products, and state:\n\n• “Whether your children will be attending school in person or online, the time to start boosting their immune system is now – not only because of the coronavirus but also because of the upcoming cold and flu season.\n#coronavirus . . .”\n\nIn a May 27, 2020, post, you link to your May 2020 newsletter titled, “The Coronavirus Fraud: Power, Control and Money” at www.hotzehwc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Hotze-Healthy-Living-Newsletter-May-2020-1.pdf, which includes the following claims:\n\n• “COVID-19 is not the lethal threat it’s made out to be . . .

Healthy people don’t get disease. So think about the A, B, C, D and Zs of strengthening your immune system. Vitamin A, B complex, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Zinc.

We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act.  Within 48 hours, please send an email to COVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations.  Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation.  Failure to immediately correct the violations cited in this letter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nFDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list on FDA’s website of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C Act. This list can be found at http://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products. Once you have taken corrective actions to cease the sale of your unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19, and such actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken appropriate corrective action.\n\nIf you cannot complete corrective action within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nIf you are not located in the United States, please note that products that appear to be misbranded or unapproved new drugs are subject to detention and refusal of admission if they are offered for importation into the United States. We may advise the appropriate regulatory officials in the country from which you operate that FDA considers your product(s) referenced above to be unapproved and misbranded products that cannot be legally sold to consumers in the United States. \n\nPlease direct any inquiries to FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov.\nIn addition, it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made.  For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the products identified above.  Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.  You must immediately cease making all such claims.  Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction and an order may require that you pay back money to consumers. Within 48 hours, please send an email to Richard Cleland, Assistant Director of the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at rcleland@ftc.gov describing the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns. If you have any questions regarding compliance with the FTC Act, please contact Mr. Cleland at 202-326-3088.\n\n\nSincerely,        \n\n/S/\nOn behalf of William A.
