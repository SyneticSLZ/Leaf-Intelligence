We have also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/foxpharma.us/ and https://www.instagram.com/foxpharma_us/. Your social media websites direct consumers to your https://foxpharma.us website to purchase your products. As described below, your injectable lipolytic products including “LemonBottle Ampoule Solution,” “Lipo Lab PPC Solution (brown vial),” “Lipo Lab PPC Solution,” “Lipo Vela,” “Lipo Lab V-Line,” “Kabelline,” and “Super V-Line Sol” are unapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).\n\nThese products are especially concerning from a public health perspective because injectable drug products can pose risks of serious harm to users. Injectable products are delivered directly into the body, sometimes directly into the bloodstream, and therefore, bypass some of the body’s key defenses against toxins and microorganisms that can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions.\n\nYour products are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended to prevent, treat, or cure disease conditions and/or affect the structure or function of the body. Examples of claims observed on your websites that establish the intended use of your products as drugs for human use include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\nLemonBottle Ampoule Solution\n\nOn your webpage https://foxpharma.us/products/lemon-bottle:\n􀁸 “[F]or fat decomposition to increase metabolism of fat cells and accelerate it.”\n􀁸 “[M]etabolic activation effect of Riboflavin separate and send out the fat cell fast lipase activity and inflammation relief”\n􀁸 “[A]ctivation of fat metabolism”\n\nOn a May 16, 2024, post on your Facebook and Instagram social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/foxpharma.us/ and https://www.instagram.com/foxpharma_us/:\n􀁸 “Lecithin destroys and transports unnecessary fat cells”\n􀁸 “Bromelain (Ananas Sativus (Pineapple)) helps to break down fat and remove inflammation”\n􀁸 “[I]f you [sic] uncomfortable with liposuction[,] diet does not help”\n􀁸 “[I]f you want to lose weight quickly in a short time”\n\nLipo Lab PPC Solution (brown vial)\n\nOn your webpage https://foxpharma.us/products/lipo-lab-10x10ml-brown-vial:\n􀁸 “Lipo Lab is one of the safest and most effective fat-dissolving products in existence today.

Subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). No approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, are in effect for these products. Accordingly, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products.
