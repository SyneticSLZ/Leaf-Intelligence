Hoffman\nCEO\nCosco International, Inc.\n\n1633 Sands Place SE\nMarietta, GA 30067\nUnited States\n\n peter@coscous.com\nIssuing Office:\nCenter for Tobacco Products\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\n\nAugust 26, 2020\n\nDear Mr. Hoffman:\n\nThe Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your submissions to the FDA and our inspection records, and determined that Cosco International, Inc. manufactures and distributes e-liquid products for commercial distribution in the United States, and that the e-liquid products are manufactured and offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United States.\n\nUnder section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1.\n\nPlease be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the Act. These products include, but are not limited to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including ecigarettes), e-liquids, cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685.\n\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded\n\nThe FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have premarket authorization. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n\nFDA has determined that you manufacture and distribute to customers in the United States the following eliquid products without a marketing authorization order: Infuze Salts Tan Lines - Baja Ice, Infuze Salts Basilisk - Iced Dragon Fruit, and Infuze Salts Labyrinth - Shortbread Cookie.\n\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act. In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The introduction into interstate commerce of any tobacco product that is adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). Additionally, to the extent that a report was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to provide such report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)).\n\nTobacco Products Without Required Ingredient Listing Submissions Are Misbranded\n\nFDA has determined that you have not provided an ingredient listing to FDA as required by section 904(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387d(a)(1)). Section 904(a)(1) requires each tobacco product manufacturer or importer, or agents thereof to provide “a listing of all ingredients, including tobacco, substances, compounds, and additives that are… added by the manufacturer to the tobacco, paper, filter, or other part of each tobacco product by brand and by quantity in each brand and sub-brand.”\n\nBecause you have not provided FDA with an ingredient listing, FDA has determined that your products listed below, which Cosco International, Inc. manufactures and offers for sale and/or distribution to customers in the United States, are misbranded under section 903(a)(10)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(10)(A)) because you failed to comply with requirements prescribed under section 904 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387d). The introduction into interstate commerce of any tobacco product that is misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). In addition, the failure to provide any information required by section 904 is a prohibited act under section 301(q)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(q)(1)(B)).\n\n \n\n#\n\n\t\n\nNAME OF TOBACCO PRODUCT\n\n\t\n\n#\n\n\t\n\nNAME OF TOBACCO PRODUCT\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\t\n\nEmpyrean Cirrus\n\n\t\n\n25\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Rings of Saturn – Watermelon Slushie\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\t\n\nEmpyrean Cumulus\n\n\t\n\n26\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Ruby – Patriotic Popsicle\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\t\n\nEmpyrean Stratus\n\n\t\n\n27\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Smooth Monkey – Banana Nut Bread\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\t\n\nHouse Blends Arctic Leaf – Cool Mint\n\n\t\n\n28\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Spectrum – Gummy Candy\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\t\n\nHouse Blends Brew – Cappuccino Italiano\n\n\t\n\n29\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Stotch – Caramel Butterscotch\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\t\n\nHouse Blends Frost – Fresh Menthol\n\n\t\n\n30\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Sublime – Fruit Twist\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\t\n\nHouse Blends Heisenberg – Blue Energy Drink\n\n\t\n\n31\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Sublime Ice – Fruit Twist\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\t\n\nHouse Blends Jam – Candied Grape\n\n\t\n\n32\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Tan Lines – Baja Ice\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\t\n\nHouse Blends Juice Box – Strawberry Kiwi Splash\n\n\t\n\n33\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Veneto – Almond Macaroon\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\t\n\nHouse Blends Steaming James – Coconut Hazelnut Tobacco\n\n\t\n\n34\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Salts Basilisk – Iced Dragon Fruit\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\t\n\nHouse Blends Strawberry Fields – Full Bodied Strawberry\n\n\t\n\n35\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Salts Bohemian Raspberry – Blue Raspberry\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\t\n\nHouse Blends Talladega – All American Tobacco\n\n\t\n\n36\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Salts Hollow – Vanilla Hazelnut\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\t\n\nInfuze ATL – Strawberry Banana\n\n\t\n\n37\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Salts Labyrinth – Shortbread Cookie\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Basilisk – Dragon Fruit Pomegranate\n\n\t\n\n38\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Salts Rings of Saturn – Iced Watermelon Slushie\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Bohemian Raspberry – Blue Raspberry\n\n\t\n\n39\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Salts Serum – Berry Lemonade\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Bohemian Raspberry Ice - Blue Raspberry\n\n\t\n\n40\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Salts Strawberry Fields – Strawberry Strange\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Blue Widow – Blueberry Doughnut\n\n\t\n\n41\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Salts Sublime – Fruit Twist\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Castaway – Tropical Fruit\n\n\t\n\n42\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Salts Tan Lines – Baja Ice\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Elementary – Berry Crunch Cereal\n\n\t\n\n43\n\n\t\n\nTop Shelf Bliss\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Forbidden Fruit – Fresh Apple\n\n\t\n\n44\n\n\t\n\nTop Shelf Hollow\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Fuzz – Orange Peach\n\n\t\n\n45\n\n\t\n\nTop Shelf Labyrinth\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Hooch – Watermelon Cactus\n\n\t\n\n46\n\n\t\n\nTop Shelf Nectar\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Lava Shark – Frosted Island Drink\n\n\t\n\n47\n\n\t\n\nTop Shelf Rapture\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\t\n\nInfuze Northern Lights – Candy Cane\n\n\t\n\n48\n\n\t\n\nTop Shelf Serum\n\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list.

Failure to address any violations of the type described above may result in FDA’s taking regulatory action. These actions may include, but are not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction.
