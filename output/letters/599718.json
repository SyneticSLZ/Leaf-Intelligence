Under section 201 (rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901 (b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b); 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2).\n\nFDA has determined that several e-liquid products advertised and offered for sale or distribution on your website are misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)) because your website advertising e-liquid products fails to include the required nicotine warning statement for several of these products.\n\nE-Liquid Products with Advertising that Fails to Include the Required Nicotine Warning Statement are Misbranded\n\nOur review of the website https://www.smoketokes.com revealed that the advertising for several e-liquid products that you sell, offer for sale or distribute in the United States does not include the required nicotine warning statement in the manner required by 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(b), for example: Coconut Lime- Lush Vapor, Skeet Skeet- Lush Vapor, Right Cheek - Banana Butt, Honey Twist - Golden Honey Bomb, Naked 100 - Naked Unicorn, and Naked Salt-American Patriots. Under 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(b), advertising for cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and covered tobacco products other than cigars, such as e-liquid products, must bear the following warning statement:\n\nWARNING: This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\n\nFor cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and covered tobacco products other than cigars, it is unlawful for a tobacco product manufacturer, packager, importer, distributor, or retailer of the tobacco product to advertise or cause to be advertised within the United States any tobacco product unless each advertisement bears the required warning statement (21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(b)(1)). Further, the required warning statement must meet the requirements of 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(b)(2). The products cited in this letter are \"covered tobacco products.\" Under 21 C.F.R. § 1143.1, a \"covered tobacco product\" is defined as any tobacco product deemed to be subject to the FD&C Act under 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2, excluding components or parts not made or derived from tobacco. Before 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2 became effective, only cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco were subject to chapter IX of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)). 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2 deems all other tobacco products, except accessories of such tobacco products, subject to chapter IX of the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations.\n\nUnder section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)), tobacco products are misbranded if sold or distributed in violation of regulations prescribed under section 906(d) of the FD&C Act, including those within 21 C.F.R. Part 1143. Because your website advertising e-liquid products does not include the required nicotine warning statement for several of these products, in violation of 21 C.F.R. §1143.3(b), these e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)).\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately correct the violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the ones stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. Failure to ensure full compliance with the FD&C Act may result in FDA initiating further action without notice, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, no-tobacco-sale orders, criminal prosecution, seizure, and/or injunction. Please note that any adulterated or misbranded tobacco products offered for import into the United States are subject to detention and refusal of admission.\n\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your corrective actions, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA's homepage at http://www.fda.gov.\n\nPlease note your reference number, RW2001241 , in your response and direct your response to the following address:\n\nDPAL-WL Response, Office of Compliance and Enforcement\nFDA Center for Tobacco Products\nc/o Document Control Center\nBuilding 71 , Room G335\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nIf you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact Ele Ibarra-Pratt at (301) 796-9235 or via email at CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/S/\n\nAnn Simoneau, J.D.\nDirector\nOffice of Compliance and Enforcement\nCenter for Tobacco Products\n\n\nVIA UPS and Electronic Mail\n\ncc:\n\nAttn: Smoke Tokes\n309 South San Pedro Street\nLos Angeles, CA 90013\nshop@smoketokes.com\n\nSmoke Tokes\nSales@smoketokes.com\n\nGoDaddy.com, LLC\nabuse@godaddy.com\n\nShopify, Inc.\nabuse@shopify.com",
