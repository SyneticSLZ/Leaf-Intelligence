For example, under 21 CFR 101.93(g)(2)(iv)(C), a citation of a publication or reference in the labeling of a product is considered to be a claim about disease treatment or prevention if the citation refers to a disease use, and if, in the context of the labeling as a whole, the citation implies treatment or prevention of a disease. The following are examples of citations to scientific publications or references you use to market your products for disease treatment and prevention on your website www.greatlakesgelatin.com:\n\nCollagen Hydrolysate, Keto Collagen + MCT, and Collagen Endurance Plus products\n\nUnder the blog titled “COLLAGEN SUPPLEMENTATION AND BONE AND JOINT HEALTH” on your website:\n• Moskowitz, Roland. Role of collagen Hydrolysate in Bone and Joint Disease. Seminars is Arthritis and Rheumatism 2000; 30(2): 87-99.\n• Porfirio, E., Fanaro, G. Collagen supplementation as a complementary therapy for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis: a systematic review. Rev. Bras. Geriatr. Gerontol; 2016 19(1): 153-164.\n\nCollagen Hydrolysate (10 oz unflavored, 16 oz unflavored, Convenience Pack (20 count unflavored), 8lb unflavored) products, which contain Type I collagen as indicated on your website\n\nUnder the blog titled “COLLAGEN SUPPLEMENTATION AND GASTROINTESTINAL HEALTH” on your website:\n• Ramadass, S., Jabaris, SL., Perumal RK., HairulIslam VI., Gopinath, A., Madhan, B.

European Journal of Pharmaceutical Science 2016 91:216-224.\n\nYour Collagen Hydrolysate, Keto Collagen + MCT, and Collagen Endurance Plus products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour products Collagen Hydrolysate, Keto Collagen + MCT, and Collagen Endurance Plus products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Collagen Hydrolysate, Keto Collagen + MCT, and Collagen Endurance Plus fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps that you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete addressing these violations within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Lauren Crivellone, Compliance Officer, Food and Drug Administration, 550 West Jackson Boulevard, Suite 1500, Chicago, IL 60661.
