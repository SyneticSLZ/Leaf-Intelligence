The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your website at the Internet address https://bullykamp.com/ in May and June 2024 and has determined that you offer these products for sale there.\n\nBased on our review of your website, your products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)], because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. Also, these animal drugs are misbranded under section 502(o) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(o)] because they have not been drug listed with FDA. For the reasons described below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nYou can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\n\nExamples of claims FDA observed on your website and products labeling that show the intended use of your products include the following:\n\nFrom your home website titled “THE ANTIDOTE !!! **** (PARVO KILLER)” at the URL https://bullykamp.com/store/ols/products/the-antidote--parvo-killer:\n\n“… help combat the following symptoms:\n\n    o PARVO\n    o COCCIDIA\n    o GIARDIA\n    o DISTEMPER\n    o KENNEL COUHG [sic]\n    o PYOMETRA\n    o MASTITIS\n    o PRE-BREEDING TREATMENT\n\nFrom your home website titled “Steroid Shot 5ML” at the URL https://bullykamp.com/store/ols/products/steroid-shot-5ml:\n\n“… used to treat mild inflammatory conditions and/or to suppress the inflammation associated with an allergic response.”\n\nFrom your home website titled “Increase Litter Shot” at the URL https://bullykamp.com/store/ols/products/increase-litter-shot:\n\n“Increase Litter Shot…Process should start once you notice your female bleeding.”\n\nFrom your home website titled “Clavamox 5ML” at the URL https://bullykamp.com/store/ols/products/clavamox-5ml:\n\n“MEDECINE [sic] / ANTIBIOTICS”\n\nFrom your home website titled “BULLDOG SAUCE” at the URL https://bullykamp.com/store/ols/products/bulldog-sauce:\n\n“…. an effective treatment for most skin disorders and skin-related ailments. Use BULLDOG SAUCE to speed the healing of cuts, bruises, burns, swelling and hair loss.\n“… For: MANGE, HOT SPOTS, RASHES, RINGWORMS [sic], HAIR LOSS, EXCESSIVE ITCHING, BELLY RASHES, ETC...”\n\nFrom your Facebook post titled “BullyKAMP Products” at the URL https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=821824236642611&set=pb.100064451271781.- 2207520000&type=3 dated April 20:\n\n“THE ANTIDOTE!!! **** (PARVO KILLER)”\n\nFrom your Facebook post titled “BullyKAMP Products” at the URL https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=742630577895311&set=pb.100064451271781.- 2207520000&type=3 dated December 9, 2023.\n\n“… We got it. #parvokiller #bullykampproducts”\n\nFrom your Facebook post titled “BullyKAMP Products” at the URL https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=713362597488776&set=pb.100064451271781.- 2207520000&type=3 dated October 17, 2023:\n\n“Get rid of PARVO… the Antidote”\n“… good to have on hand. Pups can turn bad at any moment. #parvo #killer #antidote #bullykampproducts”\n\nFrom your Facebook post titled “BullyKAMP Products” at the URL https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=749197433905292&set=pb.100064451271781.- 2207520000&type=3 dated December 20, 2023:\n\n“Got skin issues? Well look no further. We got the cure.”\n\nThese products are new animal drug under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. 321(v)], because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.\n\nTo be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. These products are not approved or index listed by FDA, and therefore, the products are unsafe within the meaning of section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)], and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated drug is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products.
