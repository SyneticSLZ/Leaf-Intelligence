The claims on your website and social media website establish that your “Plasma Colloidal Silver Eyedrops,” “Gaia’s Organic Nasal Spray,” “Copper Healing Roller,” “Plasma Copper Elixer,” “Plasma Gold Elixer,” “Plasma Gold & Silver Elixer Package,” and “Plasma Silver Elixer” products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). FDA has also determined that your “Plasma Colloidal Silver Eyedrops” and “Copper Healing Roller” products are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a) and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n\n\nThe Agency is particularly concerned that you market your “Plasma Colloidal Silver Eyedrops,” “Gaia’s Organic Nasal Spray,” and “Copper Healing Roller” products for use in children. The use of untested drugs can have unpredictable and unintended consequences, especially in vulnerable populations, such as children, who may be at greater risk for adverse reactions associated with certain drug products due to their differences in the ability to absorb, metabolize, distribute, or excrete such drug products or their metabolites.\n\nFurther, your “Plasma Colloidal Silver Eyedrops” product is especially concerning from a public health perspective because ophthalmic drug products can pose serious risk of harm to humans and/or animals if toxic substances are introduced directly into the eye because irreversible damage, including vision loss, can result. Your “Gaia’s Organic Nasal Spray” intranasal drug product is also concerning because it may be rapidly absorbed through the highly vascularized nasal mucosa directly into systemic blood circulation, where they may exert undesirable systemic effects such as increased heart rate or elevated blood pressure. If toxic substances are introduced directly into the nose, harmful local effects such as bleeding, ulceration, or nasal septal perforation may occur.\n\nUnapproved New Drug Products\n\nBased on our review of your websites, your “Plasma Colloidal Silver Eyedrops,” “Gaia’s Organic Nasal Spray,” “Copper Healing Roller,” “Plasma Copper Elixer,” “Plasma Gold Elixer,” “Plasma Gold & Silver Elixer Package,” and “Plasma Silver Elixer” products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nSome examples of claims observed on your website and social media websites that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include, but may not limited to, the following:\n\nFrom your website https://newearthhealingessentials.ecwid.com/:\n\nFrom your webpage titled “Plasma Colloidal Silver Eyedrops”:\n• “Our Colloidal Silver Eyedrops include a 2oz bottle of our colloidal silver that contains minimal amounts of our turmeric extract so it is safe to be used in the eyes for any infections, irritations, and to protect against any viruses, can be used for children, adults and pets.\nThese eyedrops provide protection and healing from any infections, bacteria or viruses in the eyes and can be used on-the-go.”\n\nFrom your webpage titled “Gaia’s Organic Nasal Spray”:\n• “Our Gaia’s Organic Nasal Spray assists with clearing out the sinuses which tend to hold a lot of density.

Studies have found that the silver nano particle-containing dressings exhibited antibacterial effects and were effective against diabetic ulcers, leg ulcers, other types of ulcers, and was effective with healing the wounds of skin graft donors.”\n\n• “To touch on the subject lightly, here is a list diseases Colloidal Silver has been known to treat:\n\n‘Colloidal silver is used to treat infections due to yeast; bacteria (tuberculosis, Lyme disease, bubonic plague, pneumonia, leprosy, gonorrhea, syphilis, scarlet fever, stomach ulcers, cholera); parasites (ringworm, malaria); and viruses (HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, herpes, shingles, warts).\n\nColloidal silver is also used for lung conditions including emphysema and bronchitis; skin conditions including rosacea, cradle cap (atopic dermatitis), eczema, impetigo, and psoriasis; and inflammation (sometimes due to infection) of the bladder (cystitis), prostate (prostatitis), colon (colitis), nose (rhinitis), stomach (gastritis), tonsils (tonsillitis), appendix (appendicitis), and sinuses (sinusitis).\n\nOther uses include treatment of cancer, diabetes, arthritis, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, leukemia, hay fever and other allergies, trench foot, and gum disease.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for your products.\n\nUnapproved New Animal Drugs\n\nBased on our review of your websites, your “Plasma Colloidal Silver Eyedrops” and “Copper Healing Roller,” products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because these products are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals.\n\nExamples of claims observed on your website that show the intended uses of your “Plasma Colloidal Silver Eyedrops” and “Copper Healing Roller” products include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\nFrom your website https://newearthhealingessentials.ecwid.com/: Webpage titled – “Plasma Colloidal Silver Eyedrops”\n• “Our Colloidal Silver Eyedrops include a 2oz bottle of our colloidal silver that contains minimal amounts of our turmeric extract so it is safe to be used in the eyes for any infections, irritations, and to protect against any viruses, can be used for children, adults and pets.\n\nThese eyedrops provide protection and healing from any infections, bacteria or viruses in the eyes and can be used on-the-go.”\n\nFrom your website https://newearthhealingessentials.ecwid.com/: Webpage titled – “Copper Healing Roller”\n• This roller is perfect for your face & body and can also be used on children & pets to heal skin irritations and scarring.\n\nThese products are “new animal drugs,” as defined by section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because they are not generally recognized among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. These products are not the subject of approved new animal drug applications, conditionally approved new animal drug applications, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1. Therefore, these products are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a) and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these adulterated drugs violate section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products.
