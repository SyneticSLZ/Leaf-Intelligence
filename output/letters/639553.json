Venter\nCEO\nRoyalVibe Health Ltd.\n\n1095 Evergreen Circle, Suite 200\nThe Woodlands, TX 77380\nUnited States\n\nIssuing Office:\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\nCMS: 639553\n\nNovember 18, 2022\n\nDear Dr. Venter:\n\nDuring an attempted inspection of your firm located in the Woodlands, TX on June 17, 2022 through July 5, 2022, an investigator from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your firm markets, distributes and manufactures the CellQuicken Analyzer (Smart-Watch, and Software), RoyalVibe Ultrasound Generator, Envirovibe Water Restructuring Pad, Brainvibe Neuroplasticity Visual Program, RoyalVibe Therapy Balls, and RoyalVibe Application. Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“Act” or “the Act”), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nWe have received your response via e-mail dated July 7, 2022, stating you will cease offering the RoyalVibe products for sale in the United States until you have achieved compliance with the regulations. However, your response does not address the previously marketed and distributed adulterated devices. You stated you have approximately (b)(4) customers with devices in the United States. Additionally, as of the date of this letter, your firm has several active product websites which appear to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase the products, and your companion software application is still available for download in the United States. In response to this letter, you should provide your plan for addressing the previously distributed adulterated products and provide details on the steps you’ve taken to remove your products from the US market.\n\nThe FDA has reviewed your firm’s websites and attempted an inspection and determined that the devices listed above are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). The devices are also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the devices into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency (21 CFR 807.81(b)). The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the devices is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the products may be legally marketed.\n\nYour firm markets the above referenced devices as a kit and as individual devices, intended for the diagnosis and treatment of several diseases including but not limited to cancer, Alzheimer’s, ischemic stroke, arthritis, and type 1 diabetes. Your firm’s product labeling includes claims which demonstrate the products are marketed for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. These products are devices under section 201(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. For example, your website (www.royalvibehealth.com) promotes your firm’s products for, among others, the following intended uses:\n\n• “Diagnosed Condition’s Root Causes We Can Help Treat\n    Cancer\n    Type 1 Diabetes\n    Type 2 Diabetes\n    Cardiovascular Disease\n    Alzheimer’s\n    Kidney Disease\n    Liver Disease\n    Cerebrovascular problems (stroke)\n    Lung Disease\n    Depression”\n\n• “Breakthrough Cancer Treatment: A 90% Success Rate without Side-Effects”\n\nIn addition, your RoyalVibe (www.royalvibehealth.com) and CellQuicken (www.cellquicken.com) websites contain, among others, claims and instructions for use (IFU) for the following devices:\n\nRoyalVibe Bioresonance Focused Ultrasound Generator\n\nClaims\n\n• “RoyalVibe Health uses ‘Bioresonance Focused Ultrasound’ technology and our therapy protocol help heal from different condition diagnoses, like Alzheimer's, Diabetes, Stroke, Cancer, and many others.”\n• “RoyalVibe Health uses a specific ‘Bio-Resonance Ultrasound Healing’ technology to target dangerous and toxic cells and help heal damaged and stressed cells that suffer from stress, bad diet, conventional treatments like chemotherapy, radiation, or other like from inflammation inside the body.”\n• “This technology and holistic approach can be effective for various conditions and even cancer stages, including stage 3 and stage 4 cancer.”\n• “Does it work for any disease?

Based on this, the Therapy Balls Spine Alignment product is a device under section 201(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nBrainVibe Neuroplasticity Program\n\nIFU\n\n• Screenshot of companion app includes an Audio “Treatment List” for “Addiction Reduction”\n\nClaims or statements that suggest that this product can reduce or treat addiction show an intent to mitigate or treat disease. See Act § 201(h)(2), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h)(2).

In September 2007, section 510 of the Act was amended by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-85) to require domestic and foreign device establishments to submit their annual establishment registration and device listing information to FDA by electronic means (Act § 510(p), 21 U.S.C. § 360(p)), during the period beginning October 1st and ending December 31st of each year. Our records indicate that your firm has not fulfilled annual registration and listing requirements for fiscal year 2022.\n\nTherefore, all of your firm’s devices are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), in that the devices were manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed in an establishment not duly registered under section 510 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360 and were not included in a list required by section 510(j) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(j).\n\nWe also note that an FDA investigator provided you with a Notice of Inspection on June 17, 2022, but you did not permit FDA’s inspection of your establishment located at 1095 Evergreen Circle, Suite 200, The Woodlands, TX, 77530, and you did not respond to the investigator’s subsequent requests to inspect your establishment. You indicated that your firm uses this establishment as an address for customers in the United States to return their products for repair or replacement. Thus, you denied and/or limited an inspection of your establishment where your firm’s devices are processed, packed, and/or held (see Act § 501(j), 21 U.S.C. § 351(j)).\n\nYour firm should take prompt action to address any violations identified in this letter. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Other federal agencies may take your compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations into account when considering the award of federal contracts.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to address the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address any violations included in this Warning Letter. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration as part of your response.\n\nYour firm’s response should be sent to: Jessica Mu, Director of Compliance Branch, at oradevices3firmresponse@fda.hhs.gov. Refer to the Unique Identification Number (CMS#639553) when replying. If you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Jeff R. Wooley at 214-253-5251.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of your firm’s violations. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of any violations and take prompt actions to address any violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nShari J.
