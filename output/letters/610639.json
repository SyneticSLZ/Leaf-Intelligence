During the inspection, the investigator noted serious deficiencies in your practices for producing sterile drug products, which put patients at risk.\n\nFDA issued a Form FDA 483 to your firm on February 14, 2019. FDA acknowledges receipt of your facility’s responses, dated February 20, 2019 and March 4, 2019. Based on this inspection, it appears that you produced drug products that violate the FDCA.\n\nA. Compounded Drug Products Under the FDCA\n\nSection 503A of the FDCA describes the conditions under which human drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist in a State licensed pharmacy or a Federal facility, or a licensed physician, qualify for exemptions from three sections of the FDCA: compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) (section 501(a)(2)(B)); labeling with adequate directions for use (section 502(f)(1)); and FDA approval prior to marketing (section 505) [21 U.S.C. §§ 351(a)(2)(B), 352(f)(1) and 355(a)]. Receipt of valid prescriptions for individually-identified patients is one of the conditions for the exemptions under section 503A.\n\nSpecific violations are described below.\n\nB. Violations of the FDCA\n\nAdulterated Drug Products\n\nThe FDA investigator noted that drug products intended or expected to be sterile were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions, whereby they may have become contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health, causing your drug products to be adulterated under section 501(a)(2)(A) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(A)]. For example:\n\n1. Your firm continued to produce and distribute sterile drug products during and after maintenance on the HVAC system, which included the replacement of the (b)(4) for the sterile suite, without cleaning and recertification of the room following the installation.\n\n2. Your firm failed to maintain adequate pressure differentials between areas of higher quality and lower quality air.\n\n3. Your firm failed to routinely use a sporicidal agent as part of your disinfection program for the aseptic processing area.\n\n4. Your media fills were not performed under the most challenging or stressful conditions. Therefore, there is a lack of assurance that your firm can aseptically produce drug products intended to be sterile within your facility.\n\n5. Firm personnel donned and reused gowning apparel improperly, which may have caused the gowning apparel to become contaminated.\n\n6. Firm personnel were observed using poor aseptic technique that included leaning into the ISO 5 laminar flow hood.\n\nUnder section 301(a) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)], the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any drug that is adulterated is a prohibited act. Further, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FDCA [21 U.S.C. § 331(k)] to do any act with respect to a drug, if such act is done while the drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the drug being adulterated.\n\nC. Corrective Actions\n\nWe have reviewed your firm’s responses to the Form FDA 483. Regarding your responses related to the insanitary conditions, some of your corrective actions appear to be adequate. However, we cannot fully evaluate the adequacy of the following corrective actions described in your response because you did not include sufficient information or supporting documentation:\n\n1. In response to Observation 1, you included the actions taken associated with the drug products produced on 2/7/19 and 2/8/19 prior to the sterile suite recertification on 2/9/19. However, you did not provide the results of the sterility and endotoxin testing and final product dispositions for the (b)(4) products made on 2/8/19 that were not destroyed. In addition, you did not include an adequate evaluation of the (b)(4) products prepared and/or dispensed on 2/6/19. Contrary to your assertion in the response that there were no out of specification readings during the HVAC repairs on 2/6/19, a review of the electronic monitoring data reveals that the temperature in the Buffer Room was above your specification of (b)(4)° F on 2/6/19 from 8:54:51 to 12:17:25. Also, in your response to Observation 1, you state that a (b)(4) clean of the sterile suite was conducted on 2/8/19. However, the contact times for the agents used were not documented.\n\n2. In response to Observation 5, you stated that the use of sterile masks will be implemented. Your response includes the updated procedure for Sterile Lab/Cleanroom Attire, but it does not specify the process (where and how) for donning the sterile face masks. The implementation timeframe was not provided for the use of the sterile face masks, nor was the updated gowning procedure submitted with the response. In addition, your response did not address the continued reuse of sterile gowning or poor aseptic technique of leaning into the ISO 5 hoods that was cited in Observation 5, as well as during the previous inspection in 2017.\n\nRegarding your responses related to the insanitary conditions, some of your corrective actions appear deficient:\n\n1. The revised media fill procedures outlined in your response to Observation 4 are still not representative of your firm’s routine production practices. The updated media fill procedure includes (b)(4). However, your firm’s routine production processes consist of (b)(4) used in the preparation of single dose finished drug product syringes. In addition, your current media fill uses (b)(4) even though your firm does not routinely use (b)(4) in the preparation of your sterile drug products.\n\nPlease be aware that section 501(a)(2)(A) of the FDCA concerning insanitary conditions applies regardless of whether drug products you compound meet the conditions of section 503A.\n\nFDA strongly recommends that your management undertake a comprehensive assessment of operations, including facility design, procedures, personnel, processes, maintenance, materials, and systems. In particular, this review should assess your aseptic processing operations. A third-party consultant with relevant sterile drug manufacturing expertise should assist you in conducting this comprehensive evaluation.\n\nD.
