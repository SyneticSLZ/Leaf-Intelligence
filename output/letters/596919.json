Under section 201 (rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321 (rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, these products are tobacco products because they are components or parts of products made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including disposable cigarette filters, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)).\n\nFDA has determined that your NicStop Cigarette Filter products and TarTrap Cigarette Filter products are adulterated under section 902(8) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(8)) because they are modified risk tobacco products sold or distributed without an FDA order in effect that permits such sale or distribution.\n\nModified Risk Tobacco Product Violations\n\nOur review of the websites https://www.nicstopfilters.com and https://www.tartrapfilters.com revealed that you sell or distribute disposable cigarette filter products (to be used with combustible tobacco products) that are described as presenting a lower risk of tobacco-related disease, being less harmful than one or more other commercially marketed tobacco products, or having a reduced level of/exposure to a substance. Specifically, the websites https://www.nicstopfilters.com and https://www.tartrapfilters.com and/or product labels include the following claims:\n\nNicStop Cigarette Filters\n• \"NICSTOP Cigarette Filters actively removes tar and nicotine without changing the taste of your cigarettes [sic].\"\n• \"NICSTOP® cigarette filters trap up to 90% of the tar and nicotine in cigarettes without changing it's taste [sic] .\"\n• \"Less Tar & Nicotine Same Taste\"\n• \"You don't have to inhale all the hazardous tar & nicotine any longer.\"\n• \"Our filters will allow you to breath and taste better in little as an month of use [sic].\"\n• \"This small and simple life saving device, provides intensive cigarette smoke purification [sic].\"\n• \"Breathe easier. Help save your lungs and life.\"\n• \"Helps to reduce your [m]orning coughs when used regularly.\"\n\nTarTrap Cigarette Filters\n• \"TarTrap Cigarette Filters actively reduces tar and nicotine without changing the taste of your cigarette [sic].\"\n• \"TarTrap cigarette filters reduce the intake of TAR & NICOTINE.\"\n• \"TarTrap cigarette filters reduce up to 90% of the tar and nicotine in cigarettes without changing it's taste [sic].\"\n• \"TarTrap reduces most of the tar and nicotine in the cigarette smoke while you can still enjoy the full, unchanged flavor of your favorite cigarettes!\"\n• \"TarTrap filters help reduce the tar by up to 90% and many smokers love it because the taste of the cigarette does not change! [emphasis in original]\"\n• \"This small and simple life saving device, provides intensive cigarette smoke purification [sic].\"\n• \"We use the most effective, multi stage, mechanical method cigarette smoke purification that drastically reduces tar, nicotine and other hazards from smoking cigarettes without altering the taste of your cigarette.\"\n• \"Technologically advanced disposable cigarette filter that helps reduce smoking hazards!\"\n• \"Reduces up to 90% of tar from entering for lungs [sic].\"\n• \"Our filters will allow you to breath and taste better in little as an month of use [sic].\"\n• \"Regular use of TARTRAP Cigarette Filters reduce coughing, shortness of breath and relieves sore throat [sic]. [emphasis in original]\"\n• \"Reduces coughing and shortness of breath\"\n• \"Breathe easier\"\n\nA tobacco product is considered a \"modified risk tobacco product\" under section 911 (b)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387k(b)(2)(A)(i)) if its label, labeling, or advertising explicitly or implicitly represents that: (1) the product presents a lower risk of tobacco-related disease or is less harmful than one or more other commercially marketed tobacco products; (2) the product or its smoke contains a reduced level of a substance or presents a reduced exposure to a substance; or (3) the product or its smoke does not contain or is free of a substance. Under section 911 (a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387k(a)), no person may introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any modified risk tobacco product without an FDA order in effect under section 911 (g) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387k(g)). A product that is in violation of section 911 (a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387k(a)) is adulterated under section 902(8) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(8)).\n\nThe above listed products are modified risk tobacco products because the websites and/or product labels describe them as presenting a lower risk of tobacco-related disease, being less harmful than one or more other commercially marketed tobacco products, and containing a reduced level of a substance or presenting a reduced exposure to a substance. Because these products are sold or distributed to customers in the United States without an appropriate FDA order in effect under section 911 (g) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387k(g)), these products are adulterated under section 902(8) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(8)).\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nThe violation discussed in this letter does not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately correct the violation that is referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the one stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on these websites, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any other media in which you advertise comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations.
