The sales aid makes false or misleading claims and/or representations about the efficacy of Breztri. Thus, the sales aid misbrands Breztri within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a); 331(a). Cf. 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5). These violations are concerning from a public health perspective because the promotional communication creates a misleading impression regarding the overall benefits a patient may expect as a result of Breztri treatment.\n\nBackground\n\nBelow are the indication and summary of the most serious and most common risks associated with the use of Breztri.1 According to the FDA-approved Prescribing Information (PI):\n\nBREZTRI AEROSPHERE is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nLimitations of Use:\n\nBREZTRI AEROSPHERE is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma.\n\nBreztri is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to budesonide, glycopyrrolate, formoterol fumarate, or any of the excipients. The PI for Breztri includes the following Warnings and Precautions: serious asthma-related events—hospitalizations, intubations, and death; deterioration of disease and acute episodes; avoid excessive use of Breztri and avoid use with other long-acting beta2-agonists; oropharyngeal candidiasis; pneumonia; immunosuppression and risk of infections; transferring patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy; hypercorticism and adrenal suppression; drug interactions with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors; paradoxical bronchospasm; hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis; cardiovascular effects; reduction in bone mineral density; glaucoma and cataracts, worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma; worsening of urinary retention; coexisting conditions; and hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. The most common adverse reactions reported with use of Breztri are upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, back pain, oral candidiasis, influenza, muscle spasm, urinary tract infection, cough, sinusitis, and diarrhea.\n\nFalse or Misleading Claims about Efficacy\n\nPrescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading with respect to efficacy. The determination of whether a promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in light of the representations made or with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication.\n\nThe sales aid includes the prominent headline claim (emphasis original), “DIFFERENCE OBSERVED IN TIME TO ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY (OVER 52 WEEKS),” in conjunction with a graph titled, “SECONDARY ENDPOINT STUDY 1: Time to all-cause mortality in the ITT\n\npopulation,” and the following claims (emphasis original):\n\n“An observed relative difference with BREZTRI vs LAMA/LABA was shown in data published in 2020/2021, including in the New England Journal of Medicine”\n“49% Observed relative difference with BREZTRI vs LAMA/LABA”\n\nThese claims and presentation, in the context of a promotional communication describing the safety and efficacy of Breztri, are misleading because they suggest that Breztri treatment has been shown to have a positive impact on all-cause mortality (ACM) and reduce the risk of death in COPD patients. These suggestions are not supported by the cited references2,3 that analyzed data from the Efficacy and Safety of Triple Therapy in Obstructive Lung Disease (ETHOS) trial. The ETHOS trial was designed with ACM as one of multiple secondary endpoints, and due to the failure of the study to show statistically significant results on endpoints higher in the analysis hierarchy, the trial does not allow for any conclusions to be drawn from the ACM data. In addition, as the ETHOS study design required removing patients from inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) prior to entering a treatment arm, abrupt withdrawal of ICS may have been a confounding factor when analyzing any positive effect on ACM. Due to the statistical testing hierarchy failure and to the fact that abrupt withdrawal of ICS may have been a confounding factor, no conclusions about the effect of Breztri on ACM can be drawn from the ETHOS trial. We note the statement below the graph, “These results are observational in nature, and any comparisons between treatment arms should be interpreted with caution.” However, this does not mitigate the misleading impression. To date, no drug has been shown to improve ACM in COPD.4 The results of the ETHOS trial do not exclude the possibility that the benefits in ACM claimed above may be attributable to chance or to the withdrawal of ICS and not due to Breztri. These claims and presentation are concerning from a public health perspective because they overstate the efficacy of the drug and misleadingly suggest that Breztri will have a positive impact on ACM and reduce the risk of death in COPD patients.\n\nThe sales aid also includes the following claims (bolded emphasis original, underlined emphasis added):\n\n“In a 52-week study where patients had a history of exacerbations within the last year, BREZTRI was the ONLY triple therapy vs ICS/LABA to show a significant reduction in severe exacerbations”\n“20% EXACERBATION REDUCTION VS ICS/LABA[;] rate ratio: 0.80[;] P=0.02”\n\nThe presentation of these claims with the associated p-value creates a misleading impression regarding the benefit of the drug by suggesting that Breztri will have a statistically significant reduction in severe exacerbations. This suggestion is not supported by the ETHOS trial data analyzed in the cited reference5 because the reduction in severe exacerbations was not statistically significant for patients treated with Breztri relative to comparator groups. A pvalue is generally understood to indicate statistical significance if it is less than 0.05. Therefore, the inclusion of a p-value of 0.02 in conjunction with the above presentation creates the impression that the reduction in severe exacerbations was statistically significant. However, for the Breztri to inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA) comparison (i.e., “20% REDUCTION VS ICS/LABA”), the result was not statistically significant due to the p-value being greater than the significance threshold (critical value) established in the testing strategy. In the ETHOS trial6 testing strategy the raw p-value of each hypothesis test was compared to the corresponding critical value to determine whether the test was statistically significant. As the p-value for the Breztri to ICS/LABA comparison (p=0.02) was greater than the critical value (0.008) for that hypothesis test, the result, per the threshold set by the testing strategy, is not statistically significant. Therefore, the presentation of these claims (i.e., with a p-value of 0.02) creates the misleading impression that Breztri provides a statistically significant reduction in severe exacerbations compared to ICS/LABA by 20% when this has not been demonstrated. We acknowledge the footnote, “*Based on predefined Type-1 error control plan” is included following these claims and related presentations. However, this does not mitigate the misleading impression. The presentation is concerning from a public health perspective because it overstates the efficacy of the drug and misleadingly represents that Breztri significantly reduces severe exacerbations.\n\nConclusion and Requested Action\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, the detail aid misbrands Breztri within the meaning of the FD&C Act and makes its distribution violative. 21 U.S.C. 352(a); 331(a).
