Our review determined that your firm has submitted contradictory information between the labeling and the electronic listing file. As such, your firm is in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) as explained below.\n\nWe refer you to FDA’s drug listing deficiency letter notification dated October 31, 2022, describing the observed listing deficiencies in the information you submitted. We also refer you to FDA’s data removal email notification sent on December 15, 2022, informing you of a data removal action. As stated in this email, the continued deficiencies resulted in your product’s data removal from FDA’s Online NDC Directory.\n\nSection 510(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR Part 207 outline the requirements for registration and listing of drug products. In the case of, Vicks Nyquil Severe Hot Remedy Cold and Flu Plus Congestion, NDC 58933-541, the listing includes mismatched list of active ingredients between the labeling and the electronic listing file (SPL) as outlined below:\n\nThe listing file for Vicks Nyquil Severe Hot Remedy Cold and Flu Plus Congestion, NDC 58933-541, must include the name and quantity of each active pharmaceutical ingredient as required under section 510 j(1)(C) and 21 CFR 207.49(a)(4). In the listing file submitted for Vicks Nyquil Severe Hot Remedy Cold and Flu Plus Congestion, NDC 58933-541, the active ingredients included in the labeling do not match the active ingredients included in the electronic listing file in Structured Product Labeling (SPL) format. Specifically, the active ingredients described under the Drug Facts section of the labeling and Principal Display Panel image are acetaminophen, dextromethorphan hbr, doxylamine succinate, and phenylephrine, while the active ingredients included in the electronic listing file in (SPL) are acetaminophen, dextromethorphan hbr, phenylephrine, and guaifenesin. The active ingredient doxylamine is missing from the electronic listing file in (SPL) and instead guaifenesin is included.\n\nTherefore, your firm has not fulfilled its listing obligations under section 510(j) of the FD&C Act, and the failure to provide any information required by section 510(j) is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360(j) and 331(p). In addition, failure to properly list a drug with FDA also renders it misbranded under section 502(o) of the FD&C Act, and in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(o) and 331(a).\n\nComplete, accurate and up-to-date establishment registration and drug listing information is essential to promote and protect patient safety. FDA relies on establishment registration and drug listing information for several key programs, including drug establishment inspections, supply chain security, and post-market surveillance. Drug registration and listing information is also widely used outside FDA for purposes such as electronic prescribing and electronic health records, insurance reimbursement, and patient education.\n\nWe note that this warning letter only addresses registration and listing issues associated with your product. It is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of any violations and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the product into compliance.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. In absence of a corrective action, the deficient listing data will not be available for certification under 21 CFR 207.57(b)(2) requirements and will be ultimately inactivated by FDA. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research/Office of Compliance/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by e-mail to eDRLS@fda.hhs.gov. Please be aware that a manual override may be required for certain types of revisions made to an existing drug listing file. If you receive a validation error or have any questions regarding the contents of this letter, please contact us at eDRLS@fda.hhs.gov for further assistance. Include the case identification number, “2496” on all correspondence.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nTina Smith\nDirector (Acting), Office of Unapproved Drugs & Labeling Compliance\nOffice of Compliance\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\n\nCC: Cincinnati District Office\nAttn: toniette.williams@fda.hhs.gov",
