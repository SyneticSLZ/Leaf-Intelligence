FDA has observed that your websites offered an at-home sample collection kit that instructed individuals to send a blood sample to you for COVID-19[1] serology testing, specifically the “COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) ANTIBODY SCREENING KIT Specimen Self-Collection & Transport Kit” (also referred to as the “Drop™ Convenient Self-Collection Screening Kit, “Drop™ COVID-19 antibody test”, and  “COVID-19 Screening Test”). Based on our review, the “COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) ANTIBODY SCREENING KIT Specimen Self-Collection & Transport Kit” is intended for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19 in people, and thus, it is a device under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “Act”), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h).\n\nThe “COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) ANTIBODY SCREENING KIT Specimen Self-Collection & Transport Kit” was offered for sale and distributed in the United States without marketing approval, clearance, or authorization from FDA. Accordingly, your product is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). Your product is also misbranded under section 502(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the device into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). The introduction or delivery for introduction of this product into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a). In addition, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(k), to do any act with respect to a device while the device is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the device being misbranded.\n\nThere is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.[2] In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.[3] Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval, clearance, or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you offered for sale a product that is intended for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate corrective action to prevent the sale of such unapproved, uncleared, and unauthorized products for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.\n\nDifferent and potentially serious public health risks are presented with sample collection in the home versus a healthcare setting. Such risks may include, but are not limited to, whether a lay user can safely and properly collect the specimen; whether the components of the specimen transport media are safe for use in the home environment; adequate stability of the specimen given the time lapse between collection and testing; proper shipment; and the potential impact of shipping conditions on the sample. Your websites indicate that your product is intended to be used for at-home blood sample collection for COVID-19 serology testing, including:\n\n“COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) ANTIBODY SCREENING KIT SPECIMEN SELF-COLLECTION & TRANSPORT KIT” [www.testmydrop.com; www.coremedicalabs.com]\n“Key Benefits\nEasy Self-Collection of your blood sample.\nReduces risk of exposure to yourself and others, use in the privacy of your own home…\nProtection to our first responders. (Eliminates PPE changes)…” [www.testmydrop.com; www.coremedicalabs.com]\n“How to purchase COVID-19 Screening Test\n\nFor Health Care Professional / Bulk Order – Please contact us.\n\nFor Single / Personal Use – BUY COVID KIT NOW [when clicked, links to www.testmydrop.com]” [www.coremedicalabs.com]\n\nThe “COVID-19 Antibody Screening Test General Information” document found under the heading “COVID-19 Screening Test Supporting Documents” displays four images to demonstrate “Blood Spot Collection.” The first image displays what appears to be an individual self-collecting a blood sample with the instruction, “Lance Side of Fingertip.” The other instructions state: “Apply 4 Drops. Wait 3 Minutes. Close & Ship.” [www.coremedicalabs.com]\n“COVID-19 Antibody Test Kit\n\nOur drop™ self-collection kit contains all necessary supplies for the self-collection of one capillary blood specimen and transport system to CoreMedica Laboratories for COVID-19 Antibody serology analysis“ [www.testmydrop.com]\n\n“WHY drop™ COVID-19 ANTIBODY SCREENING TEST\n\n…drop™ is an easy-to-use, capillary blood self-collection and transport kit for professional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 virus IgG and IgM antibodies. The capillary specimen can be collected any time and practically anywhere and with no additional requirements, as it does NOT require professional collection or self-collection under the supervision of a healthcare professional.” [www.testmydrop.com]\n\nFor more information about FDA’s regulation of devices used to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19; frequently asked questions; and other helpful resources, visit our website at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/medical-devices-and-covid-19-pandemic.

This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your product(s) or operations. It is your responsibility to ensure that the products you sell are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your product(s) as safe and/or effective for a COVID-19-related use for which they have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that you do not make claims that adulterate or misbrand the product(s) in violation of the Act. Within 48 hours, please send an email to COVID-19-Task-Force-CDRH@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to prevent future violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. Failure to prevent future violations may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.  \n\nFDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list on FDA's website of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the Act. This list can be found at https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-products. Once you have taken corrective actions to cease the sale of your unapproved, uncleared, and unauthorized product(s) for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19, and such actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken appropriate corrective action.\n\nIf you cannot complete corrective action within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections. If you believe that your product is not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nPlease direct any inquiries to FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CDRH@fda.hhs.gov. \n\n \n\nSincerely,\n\n/S/\n\nTimothy Stenzel, M.D., Ph.D.\nDirector\nOHT7: Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health\nOffice of Product Evaluation and Quality\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\n \n\n[1] As explained below, there is currently an outbreak of a respiratory disease named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19).\n\n[2] Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex M.
