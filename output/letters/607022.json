Au-Yeung\nEightCig LLC d/b/a EightCig Distribution\n\n3010 E Alexander Road, Suite 1002\nNorth Las Vegas, NV 89030\nUnited States\n\n info@eightcig.com\n info@eightvape.com\nIssuing Office:\nCenter for Tobacco Products\n\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\n\nThe Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed the websites https://www.eightcig.com and https://www.eightvape.com and determined that electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) products listed there are offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United States.   \n\nUnder section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are components or parts of products made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption.  Certain tobacco products, including ENDS, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, ENDS are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act. \n\nPlease be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the FD&C Act.  These products include, but are not limited to, ENDS (including e-cigarettes), e-liquids, cigars, and pipe tobacco.  See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. \n\nThe FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have premarket authorization.  A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)).  Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2)the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3).  \n\n \n\nA New Tobacco Product Without Required Marketing Authorization is Adulterated and Misbranded \n\nOur review of the websites https://www.eightcig.com and https://www.eightvape.com revealed that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States the following ENDS product without a marketing authorization order: Wizman Puff Boy 200W Mod. \n\nThe ENDS product listed above is a new tobacco product because it was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007.  This product does not have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and is not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, this product is adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act.  In addition, it is misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. \n\n \n\nAdditional Considerations \n\n \n\nFDA finds your product particularly concerning because the design of the Wizman Puff Boy 200W Mod ENDS product (see Exhibit A) is likely to appeal to children.  In particular, your product appears to imitate handheld video gaming products, such as Nintendo’s Game Boy portable video game system (see Exhibit B), that are commonly marketed toward and/or appealing to children.  Further, the product’s design is likely to promote the use of the product by minors because it helps conceal the nature of the product as a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults.  The product appears to be a handheld video game console, which is commonly used by youth, and therefore could be openly carried without revealing to parents, teachers, or other adults that the product is a tobacco product.  FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of ENDS products. Any efforts to entice minors to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA.  Sales of such products to minors are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales and maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with ENDS products.\n\n \n\n \n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations.  Failure to address any violation of the type described above may result in FDA’s initiating action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction.  However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.  Please note that adulterated and misbranded tobacco products offered for import into the United States are subject to detention and refusal of admission. \n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list.  You should promptly correct the violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the one stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.   \n\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your corrective actions, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.  If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.  You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov.  \n\nPlease note your reference number, RW2001264, in your response and direct your response to the following address:  \n\nDPAL-WL Response, Office of Compliance and Enforcement\nFDA Center for Tobacco Products\nc/o Document Control Center\nBuilding 71, Room G335\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002 \n\nIf you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact Ele Ibarra-Pratt at (301) 796-9235 or via email at CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/S/\n\nAnn Simoneau, J.D.\nDirector\nOffice of Compliance and Enforcement\nCenter for Tobacco Products\n\n \n\nVIA UPS and Electronic Mail\n\ncc:\n\nEightCig LLC\nAttn: Qian Xu\n6175 S.
