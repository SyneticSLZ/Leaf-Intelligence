The devices are also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because for each of the above listed devices your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the devices into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency (21 CFR 807.81(b)). The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the device is described on the Internet at http://wvvw.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HovvtoMarketYourDevice/d efault.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed.\n\nOur review of your firm's website (https://wvvvv.ostarbeauty.com/, last accessed on 11/29/2023), revealed claims such as the following:\n\n3 Levels Injection Insulin Gun Hyaluronic Acid Skin Injection Needle Free Pen (Model Number: OB-N 04)1\n\n\"The hyaluron pen is a device that provides a quick administration of hyaluronic acid into your skin.

In September 2007, section 510 of the Act was amended by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-85) to require domestic and foreign device establishments to submit their annual establishment registration and device listing information to FDA by electronic means [section 510(p) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360(p))] during the period beginning October 1' and ending December 31' of each year. As of this date, our records indicate that your firm has not fulfilled annual registration and listing requirements for fiscal year 2023.\n\nTherefore, the listed devices are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), in that the devices were manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed in an establishment not duly registered under section 510 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360), and the devices were not included in a list required by section 510(j) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360(j)).\n\nGiven the serious nature of the violations of the Act, 3 Levels Injection Insulin Gun Hyaluronic Acid Skin Injection Needle Free Pen, Powered LED Microneedling Device Rechargeable Dermapen for Acne and Stretchmarks Removal, Power Microneedling device Anti Backflow LCD Dennapen LED Therapy, Red LED Vibrating Photon 540 600 Needles Microneedling Derma Roller, Rechargeable Silicone Bendable Gene Biology LED Facial Light Therapy Mask, OstarBeauty Wireless 7 Color LED Light Therapy Facial Mask with Neck, LED PDT Phototherapy LED Light Beauty Machine for Face and Body Treatment, Supper Effective 650nm Laser Hair Growth Helmet Cap, Home Cryolipolysis Fat Freezer Weight Loss Body Shape CryoPad, and Electroporation Mesotherapy Needle-Free Injection Beauty Machine, are devices subject to refusal of admission under section 801(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 381(a), in that they appear to be adulterated. As a result, FDA is taking steps to refuse entry of these devices into the United States, known as \"detention without physical examination,\" until these violations are addressed. In order to remove the devices from detention, your firm should provide a written response to this Warning Letter as described below and address the violations described in this letter. We will notify you regarding the adequacy of your firm's response and the need to inspect your firm's facility to verify that the appropriate corrections and/or corrective actions have been made.\n\nOther federal agencies may take your compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations into account when considering the award of federal contracts.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to address the noted violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm's planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Please provide a translation of documentation not in English to facilitate our review. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration as part of your response.\n\nYour firm's response should be sent by email to CDRHWarningLetterResponses@fda.hhs.gov or by mail to Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Office of Regulatory Programs, Division of Regulatory Programs 2: Establishment Support, Regulatory Inspections and Audits Team, White Oak Building 66, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993.
