These social media websites direct consumers to your website https://www.crystalclearsupplements.com/ to purchase your products. The claims on your website, social media websites and product packaging establish that your products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\n\nFurthermore, FDA has warned consumers about products containing tianeptine, which is used as a prescription drug in some European, Asian, and Latin American countries but is not an FDA-approved drug in the United States. The FDA is aware of several serious adverse event reports associated with tianeptine and that consumers may find themselves addicted to tianeptine.\n\nBased on our review of your website, social media websites, and product packaging, your “Tianeptine Sodium Powder,” “Tianeptine Sulfate Powder,” “PEA Capsules,” “Phenibut Capsules,” “Synephrine Powder,” “Noopept Powder,” “L-Theanine Capsules,” and “Lutein Capsules” are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nExamples of some of the claims observed on your website, your social media websites1, and your products’ packaging that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\n“Tianeptine Sulfate Powder” and “Tianeptine Sodium Powder”\n\nFrom the product packaging:\n• “Stress Reducing\nMood Boosting”\n\nFrom the product webpages at https://www.crystalclearsupplements.com/product/tianeptine-sulfate-powder/ and https://www.crystalclearsupplements.com/product/tianeptine-sodium-powder/:\n\n• “Tianeptine . . . is an antidepressant agent that works by increasing serotonin uptake in the brain...”\n• “Tianeptine’s success in treating depression is comparable to prescription medications but with less side effects and minimal risk of abuse. Tianeptine does not slow down cognitive function, cause sleeping problems, or cause weight problems.”\n\nOn your Facebook social media website at https://www.facebook.com/crystalclearsupplements:\n\n• On your May 23, 2016 post: “Tianeptine may be used for relieving symptoms of depression, increasing cognitive ability and reducing anxiety.

Because many amphetamines used to treat ADHD have many negative side effects, some naturopaths now recommend PEA instead of other stimulants to treat ADHD. PEA also has reported antidepressant effects.”\n\n“Phenibut Capsules”\n\nFrom the product webpage at https://www.crystalclearsupplements.com/product/phenibut-capsules/:\n• “Phenibut is a derivative of the neurotransmitter GABA. . . is used to relieve anxiety, fear, tension, and to improve sleep. . .

Outside the US many countries around the world use phenibut clinically for symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression and insomnia.”\n\nOn your Instagram social media website at https://www.instagram.com/ccsupplements/:\n• On your February 27, 2017 post: “#nootropics #anxietyrelief” and “MOOD ELEVATION -ENHANCED SLEEP- HEIGHTENED FOCUS” on the product image.\n\n“Synephrine Powder”\n\nFrom the product webpage at https://www.crystalclearsupplements.com/product/synephrine-powder/:\n• “Synephrine is known for its fat burning properties . . . Research indicates that synephrine elevates metabolic rates without increasing blood pressure or heart-rate.”\n\n“Noopept Powder”\n\nFrom the product webpage at https://www.crystalclearsupplements.com/product/noopept-powder/\n• “Noopept powder is a nootropic with a molecular structure similar to racetams, known to be 1000 times more potent than the parent racetam, piracetam.

Scientific studies on animals demonstrate L-theanine’s ability to increase dopamine, GABA, and serotonin levels. One study suggests L-Theanine as a possible treatment of tobacco addiction because of its ability to inhibit the rewarding effects of nicotine and decrease the number of [sic] that can react to nicotine.”\n\n“Lutein Capsules”\n\nFrom the product webpage at https://www.crystalclearsupplements.com/product/lutein-capsules/:\n• “Tags: cataract natural care, cataract natural cure, . . . eye natural treatment”\n• “Lutein eye benefits include cataract care as well.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to address the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly address these violations may result in enforcement action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps that you have taken to address these violations.
