We reviewed your product listings for Apple Cider Vinegar Capsules, Ashwagandha Capsules, Garcinia Cambogia Capsules, and Turmeric Curcumin with Bioperin Capsules. The product descriptions on these listings provide evidence that these products are intended for use as drugs include the following:\n\nOn the Apple Cider Vinegar Capsules webpage, https://www.amazon.com/Strength-Capsules-Bloating-Non-Stimulating-Digestion/dp/B07B2BS1FK/ref%3Dsr_1_7?dchild=1&amp;keywords=orphic%2Bnutrition&amp;qid=1606890827&amp;sr=8-7\n• “Indications…lowers blood sugar and fights diabetes, lower cholesterol.”\n\nOn the Ashwagandha Capsuleswebpage, https://www.amazon.com/Ashwagandha-Anti-Anxiety-Supplements- Orphic- Nutrition/dp/B07NZ8Q3V9/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&keywords=orphic+n utrition&qid=1606893310&sr=8-9:\n• “Anti-Anxiety Supplements…”\n• “Ashwagandha is an ancient medicinal herb used to . . . reduce inflammation . . ..

With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour Apple Cider Vinegar Capsules, Ashwagandha Capsules, Garcinia Cambogia Capsules, Premium Collagen Peptides Capsules, Elderberry Gummies, and Omega 3 Fish Oil Softgels are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Apple Cider Vinegar Capsules, Ashwagandha Capsules, Garcinia Cambogia Capsules, Premium Collagen Peptides Capsules, Elderberry Gummies, and Omega 3 Fish Oil Softgels fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products.
