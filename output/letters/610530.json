The FDA has observed that you offer for sale in the United States veterinary products1 for the use in aquarium species, including Chloroquine Phosphate products.2 The claims on your website establish that these products are drugs under Section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)] because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals or because they are intended to affect the structure or function of the body of animals. Based on our review, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs. An unapproved new animal drug is unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)] and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)]. Introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce adulterated drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nStatements on your website that establish the intended uses of your products include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nChloroquine Pellet\n• “Chloroquine Pellet is used as both a treatment option and a preventative. It is a bacteriacide, algaecide and antiparasitic medication. An excellent general cure as well as a focused treatment against ICH, excess slim coat and flukes. Chloroquine phosphate has been gradually replacing copper sulfate and quinine as the drug of choice due to its superiority.”\n\nChloroquine Flake\n• “Chloroquine Flake is used as both a treatment option and a preventative. It is a bacteriacide, algaecide and antiparasitic medication. An excellent general cure as well as a focused treatment against ICH, excess slim coat and flukes.

It is a bacteriacide, algaecide and antiparasitic medication. An excellent general cure as well as a focused treatment against ICH, excess slim coat and flukes. Chloroquine phosphate has been gradually replacing copper sulfate and quinine as the drug of choice due to its superiority.”\n• “It has shown to be effective against most protozoans and tapeworms as well as external parasites.”\n• “To treat protozoan infections a single dose of 60mg/g (15 mg/l) is all that is necessary.”\n\nMedicine Cabinet\n• “No one ever plans on having to deal with disease in their aquarium, but there will come that day when something goes wrong. It is inevitable. Our Medicine Cabinet includes equal amounts of 6 types of medicated flake at a discounted price. Stock up and don't be caught off guard!”\n\nDoxycycline Hyclate\n• “Doxycycline Hyclate Powder is a broad spectrum antibiotic derived from oxytetracycline.

It is also effective against protozoan parasites such as Cryptocaryon in marine aquaria or against Hexamita and Ichthyophthirius.”\n• “Antibacterial Treatment: Metronidazole has proven to be effective against anaerobic bacteria, hence its recommendation as an antibiotic. However, we recommend using in combination with Neomycin, especially when attempting to treat bloat.”\n• “Nematode or Trematode Treatment: Metronidazole is effective when used in combination with Praziquantel for internal parasites.”\n\nNeomycin Sulfate Powder\n• “Neomycin Sulfate Powder is a second generation antibiotic that targets pseudomonas, tuberculosis, and other gram negative bacteria in both freshwater and saltwater environments.”\n• “Treating Tuberculosis: Dose daily for 30 days minimum when treating resistant forms of tuberculosis.”\n\nNitrofuracin Green\n• “Nitrofuracin Green is a blend of Nitrofurazone, Sulfathiazole Sodium, Methylene Blue and Sodium Chloride.

It is known as a last chance treatment as it often provides results when other, more common treatments have failed.”\n• “Effective Against: Known to be highly effective against resistant aerosomas [sic] and bacterial hemorraghic septecemia which both tend to be deadly if not treated early. Also, effective against tail & fin rot and some columnaris strains.”\n\nOxytetracycline Hydrochloride Powder\n• “Oxytetracycline Hydrochloride Powder is a popular antibiotic due to its ability to treat both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

As drugs for minor species, they are considered “new animal drugs” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(v)] because they are not the subject of a final FDA regulation published through notice and comment rulemaking finding that the drug has been generally recognized among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or listing on the Index of Legally Marketed Unapproved New Animal Drugs for Minor Species (“index listing”) under section 512, 571, or 572 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b, 360ccc, or 360ccc-1]. The animal drugs named above have not been approved, conditionally approved, or index listed. Animal drugs that lack the required approval or index listing are \"unsafe\" and \"adulterated\" under sections 512(a) and 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 360b(a) and 351(a)(5)]. Introduction of an adulterated animal drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nIn addition, your pellet and flake products3 are intended to be used as a food; for example, your Chloroquine Pellet product page includes the statement, “Offer as the only food source for 14-21 days as a treatment…” and your Antibiotic Duo Flake product page includes the statement, “Offer as the only food for 10-14 days.” As defined by section 201(w) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(w)], an article which is intended for use for food for animals other than man and which is intended for use as a substantial source of nutrients in the diet of the animals is an “animal feed.” To the extent your pellet and flake products are animal feeds that contain unsafe new animal drugs, they are unsafe animal feeds within the meaning of section 512(a)(2) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)(2)]. Such unsafe animal feeds are adulterated drugs within the meaning of section 501(a)(6) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(6)].\n\nFinally, to the extent your pellet and flake products are “food,” as defined by section 201(f) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(f)],1 they are adulterated foods within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)], which states that a food is adulterated if it bears or contains a new animal drug that is unsafe within the meaning of section 512 of the FD&C Act. As noted above, your products contain unsafe new animal drugs within the meaning of section 512(a) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act.\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to address this matter may lead to legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. You should notify this office, via e-mail, within the following timeframes, of the steps you are taking to correct any violations: Chloroquine Powder, Chloroquine Flake, and Chloroquine Pellets within two (2) working days of the receipt of this letter, all other products within fifteen (15) working days of the receipt of this letter. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within the above timeframes, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, please provide us with your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour response should be sent via e-mail to Dr. Vic Boddie at Vic.Boddie@fda.hhs.gov. If you have any questions about this letter, please contact Dr. Boddie at 240-402-5618.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nMr. Eric M.
