New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)], if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision of, a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour products, “Glycostasis,” “Glucosamine Curcumin,” “Turmeric 50,” “Turmeric Curcumin,” “Cetyl Curcumin,” “Ashwagandha,” “Huruli,” “Black Seed Oil,” “Curcumin Turmerone,” and “Ashwagandha Honey” are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, “Glycostasis,” “Glucosamine Curcumin,” “Turmeric 50,” “Turmeric Curcumin,” “Cetyl Curcumin,” “Ashwagandha,” “Huruli,” “Black Seed Oil,” “Curcumin Turmerone,” and “Ashwagandha Honey” fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nYou should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nWithin fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation.\n\nIf you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nIf you have questions regarding the content of this letter you may contact Patricia F. Hudson, Compliance Officer at (404) 253-2221, or via email at patricia.hudson@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nIngrid A.
