Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685. \n\nThe FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have premarket authorization.  A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)).  Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3).\n\nA New Tobacco Product Without Required Marketing Authorization is Adulterated and Misbranded\n\nOur review of the website https://vapecentric.com revealed that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States the following e-liquid product without a marketing authorization order: Pink Sticks. \n\nThe e-liquid product listed above is a new tobacco product because it was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007.  This product does not have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and is not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement.  Therefore, this product is adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act.  In addition, it is misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act because a notice or other information respecting this product was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\n \n\nAdditional Considerations\n\n \n\nFDA finds your product particularly concerning because the Pink Sticks e-liquid product (see Exhibit A) appears to imitate food products that are typically marketed toward and/or appealing to children.  Specifically, the packaging for this e-liquid product looks very similar to Pocky Strawberry biscuit sticks (see Exhibit B), which is commonly marketed toward and/or appeal to children.  FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of ENDS products, including e-liquids. Any efforts to entice minors to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA.  Sales of such products to minors are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with ENDS products, including e-liquids.\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations.  Failure to address any violations of the type described above may result in FDA’s initiating action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction.  However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.  Please note that adulterated and misbranded tobacco products offered for import into the United States are subject to detention and refusal of admission.  \n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list.  You should promptly correct any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.   \n\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your corrective actions, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.  If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.  You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov.\n\nPlease note your reference number, RW2001268, in your response and direct your response to the following address:\n\nDPAL-WL Response, Office of Compliance and Enforcement\nFDA Center for Tobacco Products\nc/o Document Control Center\nBuilding 71, Room G335\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nIf you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact Ele Ibarra-Pratt at (301) 796-9235 or via email at CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov.   \n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nAnn Simoneau, J.D.\nDirector\nOffice of Compliance and Enforcement\nCenter for Tobacco Products\n\n \n\nVIA UPS and Electronic Mail\n\ncc:\n\nMichael Daneshrad\n5015 Blackpool Avenue\nOak Park, CA 91377\n\nGoDaddy.com, LLC\nabuse@godaddy.com\n\nGoogle, LLC\ngoogle-cloud-compliance@google.com\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ",
