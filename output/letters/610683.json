The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §321(g)(1)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.

Several studies suggest that it may lower markers of inflammatory liver disorders. Anecdotal reports indicate that this may carry over to alcohol-induced liver inflammation.”\n• “Dihydromyricetin lowers expression of IL-1β, NF-κB, TNF-α, as well as several other inflammatory cytokines.

Most clinical trials support the role of garlic supplementation in lowering blood pressure.”\n\nUnapproved New Drugs\n\nYour products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above-referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d), § 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug based on scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nMisbranded Drugs\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” mean directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour products Berberine HCL, Magnolia Bark Extract, Tongkat Ali Extract, Tribulus Terrestis Extract and Garlic Extract are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self- diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your products Berberine HCL, Magnolia Bark Extract, Tongkat Ali Extract, Tribulus Terrestis Extract and Garlic Extract fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nMisbranded Dietary Supplements\n\nYour Baicalin, Curcumin, DHM, and Milk Thistle Extract products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the labeling is incomplete. Serving size must be expressed in common household measures as set forth in 21 CFR 101.9(b) followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parentheses.\n\nWe note, your Baicalin, Curcumin, DHM, and Milk Thistle Extract products’ labeling fails to declare a complete and accurate statement of the net quantity of contents. For example, the product label expresses the net weight in metric units but fails to express the weight in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce as required by 21 CFR 101.7(b)(1). For packages labeled in terms of weight, the net quantity of contents shall be expressed in pounds, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound, as required by 21 CFR 101.7(j)(1).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Lauren Crivellone, Compliance Officer, Food and Drug Administration, 550 West Jackson Boulevard, Suite 1500, Chicago, IL 60661. If you have any questions with regards to this letter, please contact Lauren Crivellone at (312) 596-4157 or email at lauren.crivellone@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nWilliam Weissinger, MS\nProgram Division Director\nOffice of Human and Animal Food\nOperations-East 6",
