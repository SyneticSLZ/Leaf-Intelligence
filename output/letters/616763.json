We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/connersclinic, www.instagram.com/conners.clinic/, and www.twitter.com/connersclinic. These websites direct consumers to your website, www.connersclinic.com, to purchase your products.\n\nThe claims on your website and social media websites establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that these products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\n“Fenbendazole Starter Pack #1”\n\nOn your webpage titled, “Fenbendazole Starter Pack #1”:\n• “Fenbendazole… is fast becoming a successful anticancer treatment in many late-stage cancers in humans due to the experience of Joe Tippens over at MyCancerStory.rocks.”\n\n“Panacur-C Fenbendazole”\n\nOn your webpage titled, “Panacur-C Fenbendazole”:\n• “How would I take it? . . .

[C]urcumin … can also halt cancer growth. Curcumin’s anti cancer effect is attributed to induce normal, programmed cell death (apoptosis) in cancer cells without cytotoxic effects on healthy cells. Additionally, curcumin has been found to inhibit mTOR complex, which is a major growth pathway that seems to be unregulated in those with cancer.”\n\nOn your Instagram page www.instagram.com/conners.clinic:\n• In a November 13, 2020 post with an image of your Curcu Clear product:\n    o “Potential Benefits…Boosts brain-derived neurotrophic factor, linked to improved brain function & lower risk of brain diseases” “Lowers risk of heart disease. . .”\n    o “Lowers risk/prevalence of cancer”\n    o “Reduces oxidative damage associated with Alzheimer's disease”\n    o “Reduced symptoms of arthritis”\n    o “Acts as an antidepressant”\n\n“Black Cumin Seed Oil”\n\nOn your webpage titled, “Black Cumin Seed Oil 7 fl.

By stimulating the first line of defense, i.e. NKCs, which are so effective in detecting and killing tumor cells immediately upon detection, the value of Echinacea can be readily seen.”\n\n“Glucosamine Sulfate Chondroitin Sulfate MSM”\n\nOn your webpage titled, “Glucosamine Sulfate Chondroitin Sulfate MSM – 120 Caps”:\n• “May help reduce risk of developing cancers believed to be associated with chronic inflammation.”\n\nYour “Fenbendazole Starter Pack #1”, “Panacur-C Fenbendazole”, “Breast Cancer Prevention Protocol Bundle”, “Curcu Clear”, “Black Cumin Seed Oil”, “Chronic LX”, “Cayenne”, “D3- Xym”, “Rapid Immune Boost,” and “Glucosamine Sulfate Chondroitin Sulfate MSM” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 C.F.R. § 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour “Fenbendazole Starter Pack #1”, “Panacur-C Fenbendazole”, “Breast Cancer Prevention Protocol Bundle”, “Curcu Clear”, “Black Cumin Seed Oil”, “Chronic LX”, “Cayenne”, “D3- Xym”, “Rapid Immune Boost”, and “Glucosamine Sulfate Chondroitin Sulfate MSM” products are intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self- diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your “Fenbendazole Starter Pack #1”, “Panacur-C Fenbendazole”, “Breast Cancer Prevention Protocol Bundle”, “Curcu Clear”, “Black Cumin Seed Oil”, “Chronic LX”, “Cayenne”, “D3-Xym”, “Rapid Immune Boost”, and “Glucosamine Sulfate Chondroitin Sulfate MSM” products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, these products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps that you have taken to address any violations.
