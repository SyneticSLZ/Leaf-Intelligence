Cheadle\nCo-Owner\nDavis Ventures, Inc dba The Green Herb and New Genesis Health\n\n4565 Kipling St.\nWheatridge, CO 80033-2812\nUnited States\n\nIssuing Office:\nDivision of Human and Animal Food Operations West IV\n\nUnited States\n\nJuly 31, 2020\n\nWARNING LETTER\n\nRef: # HAFW4-20-05-WL\n\nDear Mr. Cheadle:\n\nFrom March 3, 2020, through March 18, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 4565 Kipling St., Wheatridge, Colorado. The inspection revealed serious violations of FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that the products have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. Additionally, our review of your product labeling that we collected during the inspection revealed that certain of your dietary supplement products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act. You can find copies of the Act and its implementing regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n.\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your responses to the FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, dated March 27, 2020, and May 27, 2020, and we address your responses in the paragraphs below.\n\nAdulterated Dietary Supplements\n\nYour dietary supplements are in violation of the CGMP requirements for dietary supplements because you failed to establish and follow written procedures for holding and distributing operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.453. Specifically, you receive packaged and labeled\nfinished dietary supplement products at your firm for holding and distribution; however, you have not established written procedures to ensure your dietary supplements are held under appropriate conditions of temperature, humidity, and light so that the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplements are not affected (21 CFR 111.455(a)).\n\nWe have reviewed your FDA-483 responses, dated March 27, 2020, and May 27, 2020. Your March 27, 2020, response stated how holding and distributing operations are performed but did not include written procedures for our review. For example, you stated that your products are stored on shelves in your “temperature-controlled, secure lobby,” but you did not provide an SOP for storage specifying the temperature. Your May 27, 2020, response states that your “Holding and Distributing Procedures” are “in place” but provided no further supporting documentation for our review.\n\nMisbranded Dietary Supplements\n\nIn addition, your Fos-Idophilus, Breathe Eze, D-Stress, Herbal N-Zyme, System Fresh, and Ur-NAry Fresh products are misbranded dietary supplements under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101 as follows:\n\n1. Your System Fresh product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. Specifically, the directions of use for your System Fresh product suggests the consumer take 2 to 3 capsules daily but the serving size lists 2 capsules. The serving size listed should be the maximum amount of product per eating occasion.\n\n2. Your D-Stress, Herbal N-Zyme, and Ur-N-Ary Fresh products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)], in that the labels fail to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). For example:\n\nYour D-Stress product label fails to include the part of the plant from which gota kola herb and wood betany are derived.\nYour Herbal N-Zyme product label fails to include the part of the plant from which catnip gota kola, and wood betany are derived.\nYour Ur-N-Ary Fresh product label fails to include the part of the plant from which cleavers herb, cranberry extract, catnip herb, garlic, and cornsilk are derived.\n\n3. Your Fos-Idophilus, Herbal N-Zyme, System Fresh, Breathe Eze, D-Stress, and Ur-N-Ary Fresh products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutritional information on the labeling of your product does not comply with 21 CFR Part 101.36. For example:\n\nRegarding your Fos-Idophilus product:\n\no It fails to declare calories in the correct increment as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 101.9(c)(1);\no It fails to include a heavy bar beneath the last (b)(2)-dietary ingredient as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6);\no It fails to include the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calories diet.” as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D);\no It fails to declare total carbohydrate instead of total carbohydrates as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 101.9(c)(6);\no It fails to express dietary fiber to the nearest gram and indented below total carbohydrate as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 101.9(c)(6)(i);\no It fails to place “Daily value not established” only at the bottom of the Supplement Facts label and not collocated with a listed ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(c)(3).\n\nRegarding your Herbal N-Zyme product:\n\no It fails to include the quantitative amount by weight per serving size of all the dietary ingredients as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii);\no It fails to place “Servings Per Container” below the serving size as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(ii).\n\nIn addition, your System Fresh, Breathe Eze, D-Stress, and Ur-N-Ary Fresh Supplement Facts labels declare ingredients that appear to be part of a proprietary blend, but the labels fail to indent those ingredients under the term \"Proprietary Blend\" as required by 21 CFR 101.36(c).\n\n4. Your Fos-Idophilus, Breathe Eze, D-Stress, Herbal N-Zyme, System Fresh, and Ur-N-Ary Fresh products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act in that the product label fails to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(d) and 21 CFR 101.4(g)-(h). For example:\n\nYour Breathe Eze product declares “Brigham Tea Leaf”, your D-Stress product declares “Kola Nut”, your D-Stress and Herbal N-Zyme products declare “gota kola”, your System Fresh product declares “turkey rhubarb”, and your Ur-N-Ary Fresh product declares “nettles”. These names are not standardized common names (SCN) noted in Herbs of Commerce.\nYour Fos-Idophilus product incorrectly places “Other ingredients” within the Supplement Facts label.\n\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nYou should take prompt action to correct all the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nWe also offer the following comments:\n\n1. Your Fos-Idophilus product label fails to use the term “net weight” in the declaration of the net quantity of contents in terms of weight in accordance with 21 CFR 101.7(j)(3).\n2. Your Fos-Idophilus product declares “at the time of manufacture” and your Ur-N-Ary Fresh product declares “40,000 SHU/g” within the Supplements Facts label. These phrases are considered intervening material and are not permitted in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(e).\n3. Your D-Stress, Ur-N-Ary Fresh, and Breathe Eze, and Herbal N-Zyme Supplement Facts labels incorrectly declare “Ingredient”\n\nWithin fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation, such as photographs, corrective actions taken to date, or other useful information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections.\n\nFurther, section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs mean all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the inspection and assessing and collecting the inspection fees [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\n\nYour reply should be addressed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; Attn: Nancy G.
