The SELECT trial showed that semaglutide reduced major adverse cardiovascular events by 20% in adults with preexisting cardiovascular disease and obesity. This included fewer heart attacks and strokes compared to those on placebo.”\n\n• “Semaglutide improves insulin resistance. A study found that semaglutide helped improve insulin sensitivity in participants, which is crucial for managing and preventing type 2 diabetes. This improvement was seen alongside significant weight loss.”\n\n• “Mechanism of Action[,] GLP-1 Receptor Activation[,] Appetite Regulation[,] Slowing Gastric Emptying[,] Enhancing Insulin Secretion[,] Reducing Glucagon Production[,] Cardiovascular Benefits[,and] Energy Expenditure and Lipid Metabolism”\n\nOn your webpage https://primepeptides.co/products/buy-retatrutide:\n\n• “Retatrutide improves glycemic control. In a study involving patients with type 2 diabetes, retatrutide reduced HbAlc levels by up to 2.02% at 24 weeks. This indicates better blood sugar control, which is crucial for managing diabetes.”\n\n• “Retatrutide enhances cardiometabolic health. Participants in the trial experienced improvements in cardiometabolic measures, including reductions in waist circumference, blood pressure, and lipid levels. For examples, waist circumference decreased by up to 19.6 cm in some participants.”\n\n• “Retatrutide reduces liver fat. A 48-week study showed that retatrutide significantly reduced liver fat in obese patients. Those taking 8 mg and 12 mg doses saw liver fat reductions of 23.8% and 25.9% respectively, which is beneficial for liver health.”\n\nOn your blog post “Top Weight Loss Peptides: Semaglutide, Tirzepatide & More” on your webpage https://primepeptides.co/blogs/peptides/weight-loss-peptides: \n• “Top Peptides for Weight Loss: A Quick Guide” with a graphic of a woman with a measuring tape around her waist.\n\no “Semaglutide . . .Pros: Reduces body weight, controls blood sugar levels, FDA-approved for weight management . . .

It is common for diabetes medications to be used for weight management, and Retatrutide is a notable example of this trend.”\n\nOn your social media websites at www.facebook.com/primepeptidesco and www.instagram.com/primepeptidesco:\n• June 28, 2024 post: “Thanks so much for sharing your experience.

Learn how these peptides work, their potential benefits, and how they can help you achieve your weight loss goals. What You’ll Learn: How Semaglutide and Tirzepatide mimic natural hormones to reduce appetite and promote fat loss. The triple-action approach of Retatrutide for maximum weight reduction.”\n\n• From the video: “GLP-1 peptides also improve your overall health by controlling blood sugar and lowering the risk for heart problems, which are often an issue for people who are overweight. Let’s start by talking about the most popular weight loss peptide, semaglutide. Semaglutide is a medication that can help people with weight-related health issues like type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.”\n\n• From the video: “Another exciting peptide is retatrutide. It was developed by Lilly for treating obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver disease . . . What sets retatrutide apart is its triple action approach. Unlike other medications like semaglutide which only targets GLP-1 receptors, retatrutide works on three types of receptors; GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon. This unique combination helps extend feelings of fullness by slowing down the rate at which the stomach empties after meals. It also helps stabilize blood sugar levels by boosting insulin release and converting excess sugar into glucose.”\n\nYour “Semaglutide” and “Retatrutide” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p).  Subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).  No approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355 are in effect for these products.  Accordingly, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products.  You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations.  It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them.  Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct any violations.  Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation.  If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.  If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.\n\nYour response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, CDER/OC/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by email to FDAADVISORY@fda.hhs.gov.\n\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\nTina Smith, M.S.\nCaptain, U.S. Public Health Service\nDirector\nOffice of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance\nOffice of Compliance  \nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\nFood and Drug Administration\n ",
