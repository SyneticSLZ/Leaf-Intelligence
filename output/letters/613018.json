Based on our review, FDA identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act). You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n\nUnapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs\n\nFDA reviewed your website at the Internet address www.organa.net in June 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for your products Copper, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Zinc, Uplift, Immune Boost, Essiac Tea, Gold, Indium, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, Palladium, Vanadium, MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane), Relieve Progesterone Cream, and Silver Gel. We have also reviewed your social media website, www.facebook.com/organainternational, which directs consumers to your webpage at www.organa.net to purchase your products. The claims on your websites establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)] in that they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\nOrgana.net Copper product page\n• “Anemia…A copper deficiency can lead to anemia…”\n• “Heart Problems…Low intakes of copper may be associated with increased LDL ‘bad’ cholesterol and decreased HDL ‘good’ cholesterol.

The extraction went off without complication.”\n• Courtlin (pertaining to your Magnesium product): “I drink the magnesium and mineral drink and it has greatly helped my gastroenteritis issues. I have been to several doctors that have never seemed to be able to diminish the pain I used to feel in my stomach but to my surprise these have helped drastically.”\n\nIn addition, your Facebook page contains evidence of intended use of your products as drugs, including evidence in the form of personal testimonials that you posted recommending or describing the use of your products for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevent of disease. Examples of such evidence of intended use includes:\n\n• On June 15, 2020, Organa posted the following: “Rhodium is now being heavily researched as a means to treat cancer…”\n• On February 25, 2020, Organa posted the following testimonial from “Annie”: “The Silver has worked wonderfully on cuts, burns, and bugbites [sic]. We all came down with flu symptoms but since we’re all taking silver, it’s Ben [sic] going way [sic] before it can really get started. I began drinking it as soon as I felt the tickle in my thrust [sic] and I’m almost completely better belie [sic] the week is out.

I was taking products for joint support but still had pain and swelling. I RESEARCHED and read that Copper pulls nutrients into ligamints [sic]. I am moving my legs up and down the stairs and bending my legs 80% better after one week! I have suffered with this for 7 years after I had back surgery. I feel this was the missing link and very thankful this product is what they say it is”\n• On January 15, 2020, Organa posted the following: “Zinc deficiency may be contributing to the development or progression of chronic eye diseases such as macular degeneration, the major cause of vision loss among older people. In one study, vision loss was reduced by 10 percent in people taking supplements…of zinc . . .. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that indicates that poor zinc intake is related to . . . cataract formation; and optic neuritis, the inflammation of the optic nerve. Zinc is still 15% off! Head to our website now and get yourself a bottle”\n• On December 10, 2019, Organa posted the following: “Many studies have shown that a zinc deficiency can impair a large variety of immune functions and defense mechanisms in animals, and some studies have shown similar effects in humans. These effects include abnormalities and eventual shrinking of the spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes; and impaired production of antibodies-have been found to be correctable with zinc supplementation. Zinc is on sale this month! Make sure you head over to our website to get some before the sale ends!”\n\nYour Copper, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Zinc, Uplift, Immune Boost, Essiac Tea, Gold, Indium, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, Palladium, Vanadium, MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane), Silver, Relieve Progesterone Cream, and Silver Gel products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here1, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355] is in effect for any of these products. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d)].\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour Copper, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Zinc, Uplift, Immune Boost, Essiac Tea, Gold, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, MSM, Vanadium, Silver, Relieve Progesterone Cream, and Silver Gel products are intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Copper, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Zinc, Uplift, Immune Boost, Essiac Tea, Gold, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, MSM, Vanadium, Silver, Relieve Progesterone Cream, and Silver Gel products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nDietary Supplement Misbranding Charges\n\nEven if your Copper, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Zinc, Essiac Tea, Gold, Indium, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, Palladium, Vanadium, and Silver were not unapproved new drugs and/or misbranded drugs and described above, they would be misbranded foods under section 403 of the Act, as follows:\n\n1. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver,” “Vanadium,” “Zinc,” and “Essiac Tea” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 403(s)(2)(B)] in that the labels fail to identify your products using the term “dietary supplement” in accordance with 21 CFR 101.3(g), which requires that a dietary supplement be identified by the term “dietary supplement” as part of the product’s statement of identity, except the word “dietary” may be deleted and replaced by the name of the dietary ingredient in the product or an appropriate descriptive term. The product labels include a Supplements Facts label, which is evidence of your intent to market the products as Dietary Supplements.\n\n2. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Vanadium,” and “Zinc” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size on the labels are incorrect. The terms “serving” or “serving size” for a dietary supplement are defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 101.12, Table 2, as the maximum amount recommended on the label for consumption per eating occasion. The labels state the serving size is “1 tsp” while the directions indicate to “Take 2 tsp. once or twice daily as needed.” Furthermore, your “Silver” product is also misbranded because its label fails to include a serving size. The product labels fail to follow the listed “serving size” common measure with the equivalent metric quantity as required by 21 CFR 101.9(b)(7).\n\n3. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Vanadium,” and “Zinc” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) [21 U.S.C. §343(q)(1)B] and 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 343(q)(5)(F)] because the labels fail to declare the number of servings per container under the serving size on the left hand side of the nutrition label or fails to include this information as part of the net quantity of contents declaration in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii).\n\n4. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Vanadium,” and “Zinc” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343 § (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:\n\na. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver,” “Vanadium,” “Zinc,” and “Essiac Tea” products fail to enclose the nutrition information (Supplement Facts label) in a box using hairlines and titled with bolded “Supplement Facts” (not “Supplemental Facts” as incorrectly noted on your product labels) set full width, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1) and (2). Furthermore, all nutrition information within the nutrition label (Supplement Facts label) must utilize all black or one color type, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(ii)\n\nb. The labels for your “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” and “Zinc” products list iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc, respectively in the nutrition information label. Iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc are (b)(2)-dietary ingredients (i.e., a dietary ingredient that has a Reference Daily Intake (RDI). Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).\n\nc. The labels for your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver”, “Vanadium,” “Zinc,” and “Essiac Tea” products fail to include the subheading “Servings Per Container” as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(ii) and 101.36(e)(6)(i). A heavy bar must be placed beneath the subheading “Servings Per Container” except that if “Servings Per Container” is not required and, as a result, not declared, the bar must be placed beneath the subheading “Serving Size”.\n\nd. The labels for your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Vanadium,” “Silver”, and “Essiac Tea” products fail to include a heavy bar beneath the last (b)(3)-dietary ingredient (other dietary ingredient), as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6)(iii).\n\ne. The following product labels are misbranded in that they fail to list “Other ingredients” in a separate “Other ingredients” list outside and immediately below the Supplement Facts label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(g):\n\ni. The product labels for Copper and Gold list “Purified Water” within the Supplement Facts label\n\nii. The product labels for Indium, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, Palladium, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Vanadium, and Zinc list “Distilled Water” within the Supplement Facts\n\niii. The product label for Essiac Tea lists the “Other Ingredients: Distilled Water, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, and Phosphoric Acid” within the Supplement Facts label.\n\nf. The labels for your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Vanadium,” “Silver,” and “Zinc” bear the following or similar statement: “Percent Daily Values based on a 2,000-calorie diet.” This statement is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D).\n\ng. Several of your product labels are for persons within more than one group. If a product is for persons within more than one group, the percent of Daily Value for each group must be presented in separate columns, as required in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(E).\n\nh. The Essiac Tea product label lacks a declaration of % Daily Value. Furthermore, on several of your product labels the statement *“Percentage Daily Value not established” is not linked to a symbol elsewhere in the nutrition information label, as required by 21 101.36 (b)(3)(iv).\n\ni. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver,” “Vanadium,” and “Zinc,” are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] because the label fails to accurately declare the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel in accordance with 21 CFR 101.7 and 15 U.S.C.§ 1453(a)(2) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.\n\nj. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver,” “Vanadium,” and “Zinc,” are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (e)(1)] in that each label fails to list the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor in accordance with 21 CFR 101.5.\n\nk. Your Essiac Tea product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(1)(A)] because the product label bears a nutrient content claim, but the product does not meet the requirements to make such claim. Under section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act, a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient which is of the type required to be in the labeling of food must be made in accordance with a regulation authorizing the use of such a claim. Characterizing the level of a nutrient in the food labeling of a product without complying with the specific requirements pertaining to nutrient content claims for that nutrient misbrands the product under section 403(r)(l)(A) of the Act. Specifically, your Essiac Tea product label bears the claim, “Slippery Elm [an ingredient in your Essiac Tea product]: Rich in . . . antioxidants,” but use of this “antioxidant” nutrient content claim fails to comply with the requirements listed in 21 CFR 101.54(g). These requirements state, in part, that for a product to bear such a claim, a reference daily intake (RDI) must have been established for each of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim [21 CFR 101.54(g)(l)], and these nutrients must have recognized antioxidant activity [21 CPR 101.54(g)(2)]. The level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim must also be sufficient to qualify for the claim under 21 CFR 101.54(b), (c), or (e), as required by 21 CFR 101.54(g)(3). Further, nutrient content claims using the term \"antioxidant\" must include the names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim as part of the claim or, alternatively, the term \"antioxidant\" or \"antioxidants\" may be linked by a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel of the product label, followed by the name or names of the nutrients with recognized antioxidant activity [21 CFR 101.54(g)(4)]. Your claim \"[r]ich in antioxidants\" is a nutrient content claim, but Essiac Tea does not meet the requirements to bear such a claim because the claim does not include the names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim or state them on the same panel and link them with an asterisk, as required by 21 CFR 101.54(g).\n\nl. The Essiac product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the product label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction.\n\nWe also offer the following comments:\n\n• Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver,” “Vanadium,” “Zinc,” and “Essiac Tea” products contain the statement, “This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. Statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.” This disclaimer is not in accordance with the required text. Per 101.93, the required text should state: “These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” Furthermore, this disclaimer is not linked to any specific structure function claim on the product label. The FDA disclaimer statement as noted on your product label must be bolded and set off in a box, and the symbol preceding the disclaimer statement must be linked to the same symbol placed at the end of each structure function statement on the label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(d) and (e).\n\n• For your product labels, there is no provision in the regulations for the listing of “Ingredients” as a heading in the Supplement Facts label.\n\n• Your Essiac Tea product label lists the chemical preservatives sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate and phosphoric acid but does not bear labeling stating that fact, in that the label fails to include a separate description of their function as a preservative in accordance with 21 CFR 101.22(j).\n\n• The directions for use statements on your product labels are placed before the nutrition information. Directions for use are considered intervening material. All information appearing on the information panel must appear in one place without other intervening material, as required by 21 CFR 101.2(e).\n\n• The Essiac Tea product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically, “Turkish rhubarb” is not a standardized common name of a botanical dietary ingredient listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Hanna L. Potter, Compliance Officer; 6th Ave and Kipling St, DFC Bldg. 20, PO Box 25087, Denver, Colorado, 80225-0087 or via email at hanna.potter@fda.hhs.gov. You may reach Ms. Potter at (303)236-3094 if you have any questions about this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nE. Mark Harris\nDenver District Director & Program Division Director\nOffice of Human and Animal Food Operations Division West 4\n\n________________________\n\n1 Even if certain of your products, such as your Indium and Palladium products, are marketed only for nonprescription indications, they would not meet the conditions under section 505G of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355h] for lawful marketing without an approved application, including because indium and palladium were not active ingredients in any applicable final monograph or tentative final monograph issued under 21 CFR part 330, for purposes of section 505G(a), nor was marketing of these products permitted by an administrative order under section 505G(b). Additionally, these products would be misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 352(ee)] because they would be nonprescription drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act that do not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section and are not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355].",
