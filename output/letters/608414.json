The failure of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a covered facility to comply with the preventive controls provisions of the CGMP & PC rule (located in subparts A, C, D, E, F, and G of part 117) is prohibited by section 301(uu) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(uu)). You may find the Act and further information about the CGMP & PC rule through links in FDA's home page at http://www.fda.gov.\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n\nOn March 6, 2020, after being notified by your customer that three consumers reported that the incorrect masterpack was found in HEB brand Tuscan Herb Chopped Salad Kit, your firm recalled the product. You indicated in your press release that the mislabeling occurred when “[t]he incorrect masterpack (kit with dressing and other toppings) was unintentionally used during the production of the salad.” The masterpack used held dressing that contained peanut butter and almond, cashew, and chow mein noodle (wheat) toppings. In documentation provided to the Office of Human and Animal Food Operations West Division 5 Recall Coordinator on April 9, 2020, your firm indicated that the cause was that you “did not have a robust enough verification process for product changeover.” The documentation further stated that the preventive actions taken were “Modification of Masterpack consumption form (b)(4)\" and “Implementation of Masterpack verification (b)(4).” We will verify implementation of any corrective actions during FDA’s next inspection of your facility.\n\nPreventive Controls\n\nYou did not identify and implement preventive controls to provide assurances that any hazard requiring a preventive control (i.e., undeclared allergens) will be significantly minimized or prevented and the food manufactured, processed packed or held by your facility will not be adulterated under section 402 or misbranded under section 403(w) of the Act, as required by 21 CFR 117.135(a)(1) and (c)(2). Specifically, you did not identify and implement food allergen controls adequate to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard of undeclared allergens as evidenced by your firm using an incorrect masterpack in your Tuscan Herb Chopped Salad Kit. This masterpack addition error caused your product to contain undeclared major food allergens.\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for ensuring that your facility operates in compliance with the Act, the CGMP & PC rule, and other applicable laws. You should take prompt action to correct the violations noted in this letter. Failure to do so may result in regulatory action by the FDA without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nWe will verify implementation of any corrective actions during FDA’s next inspection of your facility. If you would like to provide further details pertaining to the corrective actions taken by your firm and provide documentation, including revised procedures and completed monitoring records that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, please notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) working days of the receipt of this letter.\n\nIf you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act or that you have complied with FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If the corrective action cannot be completed within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which the corrections will be implemented.\n\nYour written response should be sent to:\n\nSergio Chavez, Director, Compliance Branch\nFood and Drug Administration\nOffice of Human and Animal Foods Division West 5\n1201 Harbor Bay Parkway\nAlameda, CA 94502\n\nRefer to Unique Identification Number CMS Case #608414 when replying.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact Marjorie Schultz, Recall Coordinator/Compliance Officer, at Marjorie.schultz@fda.hhs.gov or 510-337-6898.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nDarla R.
