Certain tobacco products, including e-liquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1. Therefore, e-liquids are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n\nFDA has determined that your Wingnuts Mango Melon Kool and Wingnuts Vampire Kiss e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)) because these products were sold to a person younger than 21 years of age.\n\nTobacco Products Sold to an Individual Under the Age of 21 is Misbranded\n\nFDA’s investigation of the website https://e-smokeireland.com revealed that you sold e-liquid products to an individual under the age of 21.1 Specifically, during our investigation of https://e-smokeireland.com, a person younger than 21 years of age purchased Wingnuts Mango Melon Kool and Wingnuts Vampire Kiss e-liquids from your website. No retailer may sell tobacco products to a person younger than 21 years of age under section 906(d)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387f(d)(5)). Under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)), tobacco products are misbranded if sold or distributed in violation of section 906(d)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387f(d)(5)). Because this tobacco product is sold or distributed to persons younger than 21 years of age in violation of section 906(d)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387f(d)(5)), this product is misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)).\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., Chapter IX, relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\n\nPlease be aware that the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have premarket authorization. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007. See Section 910(a) of the FD&C Act. Retailers should discuss with their suppliers the current marketing status of any particular tobacco product’s application or any product’s marketing authorization.\n\nThe violation discussed in this letter does not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should address any violation that is referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the one stated above, and promptly take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring your products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them.
