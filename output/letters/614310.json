We also reviewed your social media website at https://facebook.com/Hallandale.Beach.2018/ where you direct consumers to your website, https://dioxidodecloro.us, to purchase your products. Additionally, we reviewed your product listings on your eCrater storefront, which you operate under the name, OCLO. The FDA has observed that your website previously offered, and your eCrater storefront continues to offer, various chlorine dioxide products, including “OCLO 3000,” for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19[1] in people. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).\n\nThere is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.[2] In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.[3] Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.\n\nSome examples of the claims on your website that establish the intended use of your products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:\n\n“Dióxido de Cloro . . . terapia alternativa efectiva contra el COVID-19, tratamiento de infecciones, algunas enfermedades autoinmunes y en terapias oxidativas para el fortalecimiento del sistema inmunológico.” “Chlorine Dioxide… effective alternative therapy against COVID-19, treatment of infections, some autoimmune diseases and oxidative therapies for strengthening the immune system.” (Translated) [from your eCrater storefront https://oclo.ecrater.com/index.php]\n“El Dióxido de cloro en solución acuosa (CDS) es un potente agente oxidante antiséptico, que combate numerosas infecciones patógenas. Además, entre sus beneficios, fortalece el sistema inmune por oxigenación celular y se ha comprobado su eficacia en el tratamiento y prevención contra el actual CORONAVIRUS.” “Chlorine dioxide in aqueous solution (CDS) is a powerful antiseptic oxidizing agent, which fights numerous pathogenic infections. In addition, among its benefits, it strengthens the immune system by cellular oxygenation and its effectiveness in the treatment and prevention against the current CORONAVIRUS has been proven.” (Translated) [from your product listing on your eCrater storefront https://oclo.ecrater.com/p/37646184/dioxido-de-cloro-cds-oclo-3000]\n“OCLO 3000 (Gotero) – Immune Booster and Antiviral\n\nDioxido de cloro (CDS) 3000 ppm\n\nEl dióxido de cloro en solución acuosa (CDS) es un potente agente oxigenante que potencia el sistema inmunológico además de resultar ser un antiseptico que permite eliminar un gran numero de patógenos. Esta solución puede ser utilizada para combatir un gran numero de infecciones virales incluyendo el COVID-19. “\n\n“OCLO 3000 (Dropper) - Immune Booster and Antiviral\n\nChlorine dioxide (CDS) 3000 ppm\n\nChlorine dioxide in aqueous solution (CDS) is a powerful oxygenating agent that enhances the immune system as well as being an antiseptic that eliminates a large number of pathogens.

We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act. Within 48 hours, please send an email to  COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to address these violations.  Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of any violations, as well as copies of related documentation.  Failure to adequately correct any violations may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nFDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list on FDA’s website of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C Act. This list can be found at http://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products. Once you have taken actions to address the sale of your unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19, and any appropriate corrective actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken such corrective actions.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you with an opportunity to address them. If you cannot take action to address this matter completely within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nIf you are not located in the United States, please note that products that appear to be misbranded or unapproved new drugs may be detained or refused admission if they are offered for importation into the United States. We may advise the appropriate regulatory officials in the country from which you operate that FDA considers your product(s) referenced above to be unapproved and misbranded products that cannot be legally sold to consumers in the United States. \n\nPlease direct any inquiries to FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov.    \n\nIn addition, it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made. For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the products identified above.  Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease making all such claims.  Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction. In addition, pursuant to the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act, Section 1401, Division FF, of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, P.L. 116-260, marketers who make deceptive claims about the treatment, cure, prevention, or mitigation of COVID-19 are subject to a civil penalty of up to $43,792 per violation and may be required to pay refunds to consumers or provide other relief pursuant to Section 19(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 57b(b). Within 48 hours, please send an email to Richard Cleland, Assistant Director of the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at rcleland@ftc.gov describing the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns.
