  "fullContent": "Product:\nAnimal & Veterinary\nDrugs\nRecipient:\nMichael Strobel\nCEO\nAurora Pharmaceutical\n\n1196 Highway 3 South\nNorthfield, MN 55057\nUnited States\n\nIssuing Office:\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine\n\nUnited States\n\nFebruary 7, 2025\n\nRe: ANADAs 200-620 Altren® (altrenogest), 200-621 SwineMate® (altrenogest), 200-718 Barrier™ for dogs (imidacloprid and moxidectin)\n\nCMS #: 698797\n\nWARNING LETTER\n\nDear Dr. Strobel:\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your promotional communications for your FDA-approved products including your company website1 and linked webpages and noted false or misleading claims and representations about the safety and effectiveness of these products. These promotional communications misbrand your products within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) section 502(a) [21 U.S.C. 352(a)] and section 502(n) [21 U.S.C. 352(n)]; section 201(n) [21 U.S.C. 321(n)]; and 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5). It is a prohibited act to distribute a misbranded product in interstate commerce. Section 301(a) [21 U.S.C. 331(a)]. This violation is especially concerning from a public health perspective because your products Altren® (altrenogest) and SwineMate® (altrenogest) have serious user safety warnings and your product Barrier™ for dogs (imidacloprid and moxidectin) has a boxed warning regarding oral exposure in dogs and topical exposure in children.\n\nProduct Information2\n\nAltren®\n\nAltren® is indicated for:\n\n“[S]uppression of estrus in mares. Suppression of estrus allows for a predictable occurrence of estrus following drug withdrawal. This facilitates the attainment of regular cyclicity during the transition from winter anestrus to the physiological breeding season. Suppression of estrus will also facilitate management of prolonged estrus conditions. Suppression of estrus may be used to facilitate scheduled breeding during the physiological breeding season.”3\n\nDue to human user safety risks, the package insert (PI) for Altren® contains user safety warning language: “Not for use in humans. Keep out of reach of children. Avoid skin contact. Altren® is absorbed through unbroken skin, and exposure may result in serious side effects to both women and men. Wear vinyl, neoprene, or nitrile gloves when handling or administering Altren®, or when touching contaminated surfaces or equipment. Latex gloves are not protective.” [Emphasis original].\n\nAdditional warning language includes:\n\n“PREGNANT WOMEN OR WOMEN WHO MAY BE PREGNANT SHOULD NOT HANDLE ALTREN®. WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE SHOULD EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN HANDLING THIS PRODUCT.\n\nAccidental absorption, such as via direct contact with the skin, could lead to a disruption of the menstrual cycle or prolongation of pregnancy….”\n\n[Emphasis original].\n\nThe PI also contains a list of people who should not handle Altren®, instructions on what to do in case of accidental exposure, and reported human effects from exposure.\n\nThe PI for Altren® further contains, among other things, additional adverse event, warning, precaution, and contraindication information.\n\nSwineMate®\n\nSwineMate® is indicated for:\n\n“[S]ynchronization of estrus in sexually mature gilts that have had at least one estrous cycle. Treatment with SwineMate® results in estrus (standing heat) 4 to 9 days after completion of the 14-day treatment period.”4\n\nDue to human user safety risks, the PI for SwineMate® contains user safety warning language stating: “Skin contact must be avoided as SwineMate® is readily absorbed through unbroken skin, and exposure may result in serious side effects to both women and men. Always wear vinyl, neoprene or nitrile protective gloves when handling SwineMate or when in contact with equipment or surfaces contaminated by this product. Latex gloves are not protective.” [Emphasis original].\n\nAdditional warning language includes:\n\n“PREGNANT WOMEN OR WOMEN WHO MAY BE PREGNANT SHOULD NOT HANDLE SwineMate® (altrenogest). WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE SHOULD EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN HANDLING THIS PRODUCT.\n\nAccidental absorption, such as absorption through the skin, could lead to a disruption of the menstrual cycle or prolongation of pregnancy....”\n\n[Emphasis original].\n\nThe PI also contains a list of people who should not handle the product, instructions on what to do in case of accidental exposure, and information on reported human effects from exposure.\n\nThe PI for SwineMate® further contains, among other things, additional adverse event, warning, precaution, and contraindication information.\n\nBarrier™ for dogs\n\nBarrier™ for dogs is indicated for:\n\n“[T]he prevention of heartworm disease caused by Dirofilaria immitis and the treatment of Dirofilaria immitis circulating microfilariae in heartworm-positive dogs. Barrier for Dogs kills adult fleas and is indicated for the treatment of flea infestations (Ctenocephalides felis). Barrier for Dogs is indicated for the treatment and control of sarcoptic mange caused by Sarcoptes scabiei var. canis.”5\n\nThe PI also contains a chart detailing the intestinal parasites and the associated stages Barrier™ for dogs is indicated to treat or control.\n\nThe PI contains a boxed warning stating:\n\n“DO NOT ADMINISTER THIS PRODUCT ORALLY”\n“For the first 30 minutes after application ensure that dogs cannot lick the product from application sites on themselves or other treated animals.”\n“Children should not come in contact with application sites for two (2) hours after application.\n(See Contraindications, Warnings, Human Warnings, and Adverse Reactions, for more information)”\n\nBoxed warnings are the most significant type of warning in a product’s labeling and are used to emphasize serious or life-threatening risks.6\n\nThe Warnings section of the PI states that oral ingestion of this product by dogs may cause “serious adverse reactions including depression, salivation, dilated pupils, incoordination, panting, and generalized muscle tremors.” The Human Warnings section states that human exposure to this product has been reported to cause “headache; dizziness; and redness, burning, tingling or numbness of the skin.”\n\nIn addition to the boxed warning, the PI contains, among other things, additional adverse event, warning, precaution, and contraindication information.\n\nFalse or Misleading Claims\n\nPrescription drug advertisements and labeling (promotional communications) misbrand a drug if they are false or misleading in any particular. See FD&C Act section 502(a),(n) (21 U.S.C 352(a),(n)). The determination of whether a promotional communication is misleading includes, among other things, not only representations made or suggested in the promotional communication, but also the extent to which the promotional communication fails to reveal facts material in the light of its representations or material with respect to consequences that may result from the use of the drug as recommended or suggested in the promotional communication. See FD&C Act section 201(n) (21 U.S.C 321(n)) and 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5).\n\nThe website for Aurora Pharmaceutical mentioned above1 includes a tab at the top of the page titled “Species,” which contains links to product-specific webpages for each product the firm markets. The webpage for Altren®7 can be found under “Equine;” the webpage for SwineMate®8 can be found under “Porcine;” and the webpage for Barrier™9 can be found under “Pets.”\n\nAltren®\n\nThe product webpage is misleading because it prominently features benefit information about the product in the center of the page, but fails to contain any risk information. See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(ii). The webpage for Altren® omits information from the PI about the significant risks to humans from potential product exposure, as well as important animal safety warning language. This omission of risk information creates a misleading impression about the potential consequences associated with using the drug.\n\nThe webpage for Altren® also contains a link to a “Product Sheet”10 which lacks fair balance because the first page contains information regarding benefits and effectiveness in a larger font and bulleted format, whereas risk information is presented only in a smaller font on the second page.11 See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(ii). The Product Sheet fails to present information relating to side effects and contraindications with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable with the presentation of information relating to effectiveness of the drug and fails to include on each page the information relating to side effects and contraindications or a prominent reference to its presence and location. 21 CFR 202.1(e)(7)(viii), (e)(7)(xii). Further, at the bottom of the webpage for Altren® there are links to print advertisements12 which contain benefit information but omit important risk information about human user safety, such as that users should wear vinyl, neoprene, or nitrile gloves when handling or administering Altren®; latex gloves are not protective. Additionally, the risk information that is present on the advertisements, such as “Pregnant women, or women who suspect they are pregnant, should not handle Altren,” is presented in a small, lightweight font which is not reasonably comparable to the presentation of information relating to effectiveness in terms of prominence and readability. See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(7)(viii). It also does not explain that women of childbearing age should exercise extreme caution when handling Altren® because it is readily absorbed through the skin and can disrupt the menstrual cycle or prolong pregnancy.\n\nSwineMate®\n\nThe product webpage is misleading because it prominently features benefit information about the product in the center of the page but fails to contain any risk information. See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(ii). The webpage for SwineMate® omits information from the PI about the significant risks to humans from potential product exposure, as well as important animal safety warning language. This omission of risk information creates a misleading impression about the potential consequences associated with using the drug. Further, the webpage for SwineMate® fails to include adequate information for use, such as the effects, routes, methods of administration, and any relevant warnings, hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions. See 21 CFR 201.105(d)(1).\n\nThe webpage for SwineMate® also contains a link to a “Product Sheet”13 which lacks fair balance because the first page contains information regarding benefits and effectiveness in a larger font and bulleted format, whereas risk information is presented only in a smaller font on the second page.14 See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(ii). The Product Sheet fails to present information relating to side effects and contraindications with a prominence and readability\nreasonably comparable with the presentation of information relating to effectiveness of the drug and fails to include on each page the information relating to side effects and contraindications or a prominent reference to its presence and location. 21 CFR 202.1(e)(7)(viii), (e)(7)(xii). Further, the print advertisement linked at the bottom of the SwineMate® webpage15 contains no risk information although there is benefit information presented. See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(1).\n\nBarrier™ for dogs\n\nThe product webpage is misleading because it prominently features benefit information about the product in the center of the page, but fails to contain any risk information. See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(ii). The webpage for Barrier™ for dogs omits the boxed warning from the PI, as well as other important animal and human safety information. This omission of risk information creates a misleading impression about the potential consequences associated with using the drug.\n\nThe ”Product Sheet”16 linked on the Barrier™ for dogs webpage lacks fair balance because the first seven pages contain information regarding benefits and effectiveness in a larger font and with numerous charts, images, and visuals, whereas risk information is presented only in a smaller font on a single page at the end of the brochure. See 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5)(ii). The Product Sheet fails to present information relating to side effects and contraindications with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable with the presentation of information relating to effectiveness of the drug and fails to include on each page the information relating to side effects and contraindications or a prominent reference to its presence and location. 21 CFR 202.1(e)(7)(viii), (e)(7)(xii).\n\nConclusion and Requested Response\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, your website misbrands Altren®, SwineMate®, and Barrier™ for dogs within the meaning of the FD&C Act and make their distribution violative.17 FD&C Act section 502(a), (21 U.S.C. 352(a)); section 502(n) [21 U.S.C. 352(n)]; section 201(n) (21 U.S.C. 321(n)); section 301(a) (21 U.S.C. 331(a)), and 21 CFR 202.1(e)(5).\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products.
