We also conducted an inspection on October 13, 2020 to October 21, 2020. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n\nThe FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food they import into the United States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals.\n\nDuring the most recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1, subpart L for the foods you import, including fresh Chayote, fresh Serrano peppers, and fresh coconuts imported from (b)(4). Because of these significant violations, you are not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act.\n\nAt the conclusion of the most recent inspection, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483a FSVP Observations. We acknowledge receipt of your response dated April 8, 2022, and we address your response below.\n\nYour response included a brief narrative summary of corrective actions your firm plans to implement. The response indicated that your firm should have an FSVP for the three food products covered in the most recent inspection by the “end of July 2022” and that your firm “will start working on an FSVP for each product/supplier [you] use.” We evaluated your response and find it inadequate because you did not provide further details or documentation regarding implementation of an FSVP program for the products you continue to import.\n\nYour significant violations of the FSVP regulation are as follows:\n\nYou did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR part 1.502(a). Specifically, your firm did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP for any foods that you import, including each of the following foods:\n\nFresh Chayote imported from (b)(4) in (b)(4);\nFresh Serrano peppers imported from (b)(4) in (b)(4); and\nFresh coconuts imported from (b)(4) in (b)(4);\n\nThe above violations are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in further action. For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food products you import. We may place the foods you import on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the foods. You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert # 99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for importation into the United States of an article of food without the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(zz)).\n\nAdditionally, we offer the following comment:\n\nYou import fresh produce, which is “covered produce” as defined in 21 CFR 112.3. Your FSVP must demonstrate that your supplier is producing the food in compliance with processes and procedures that provide at least the same level of public health protection as those required under section 419 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 350h) (regarding standards for produce safety) and the implementing regulations in the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption (21 CFR part 112).\n\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should address the specific things you are doing to correct any violations. You should include in your response documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a copy of your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), and any additional information that you wish to supply relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you believe that you are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations.\n\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: CDR Toby H. Hill, Compliance Officer, Division of Southwest Imports, One Main Place, 1201 Main Street, Suite 7200, Dallas, TX 75202. If you have any questions regarding this letter, you may contact Compliance Officer CDR Toby H. Hill via email at toby.hill@fda.hhs.gov. Please reference CMS # 631972 on any documents or records you provide to us and/ or within the subject line of any email correspondence you send to us.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nTodd Cato\nDivision of Southwest Imports Director\nOne Main Place\n1201 Main Street, Suite 7200\nDallas, TX 75202",
