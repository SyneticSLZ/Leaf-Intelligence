We have also reviewed your social media website at https://www.facebook.com/whollyliquid/, which directs consumers to your website at https://www.whollyliquid.com/ to purchase your products. The claims on your website and social media site establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n\nExamples of website claims that establish that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\nSpiroLaze\n\n• On the SpiroLaze page on your website (https://www.whollyliquid.com/products/spirolaze):\no “Supports the Elimination of Lyme Bacteria”\no “Lyme Disease”\no “Antimicrobial”\no “SpiroLaze Supports the Elimination of Lyme Bacteria.”\no “Benefits include anti-inflammatory properties, . . . speeding the physical process of healing, help for osteoporosis and osteopenia, . . . helps rid the body of chronic Lyme disease, Candida overgrowth, and helps Jaundice.”\n\n• On your Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com /whollyliquid/), an October 26, 2020, post states in part: “SpiroLaze . . . helps rid the body of things like jaundice, Lyme disease, and candida.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour SpiroLaze, BioLaze, LiquiLaurin, Vit-B12, DeStress, Omega Plus, and Ionized Silver are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, SpiroLaze, BioLaze, LiquiLaurin, Vit-B12, DeStress, Omega Plus, and Ionized Silver fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all‐inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address these matters may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Lillian C. Aveta, Compliance Officer, 158-15 Liberty Ave., Jamaica, NY 11433. If you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact Ms. Aveta at 718-662-5576 or E-mail at lillian.aveta@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nRonald M.
