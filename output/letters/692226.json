Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nThis inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. §351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. We received a response from Ms. Yi Huang, Quality and Regulatory Manager dated June 13, 2024, concerning our investigator's observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, which was issued to your firm. We address this response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for acceptance activities, which include inspections, tests, or other verification activities, as required by 21 CFR 820.80(a).\n\nFor example:\n\n1) Your firm's current incoming inspection and acceptance procedure for Biological Indicator (b)(4) (BI) is not adequately established. This inadequacy could compromise the sterilization process, potentially affecting the safety and effectiveness of the NeoZoline V ntilation Tubes. Your firm discards the Certificate of Conformance provided by (b)(4) with each BI batch, which was requested by the FDA investigator during the inspection. It appears that your firm failed to retain critical documents such as the reconciliation sheet, production batch record, or (b)(4) Certification of Conformance, which are required under your own WI22 \"Production QC and Release Product Register,\" specifically section 2.3, to demonstrate that the product was successfully sterilized. The inspection revealed that your firm does not perform BI Population verification tests on the received BI batches to ensure that the population has not changed during shipping or storage. This is a critical step is necessary to provide a high degree of assurance that the BIs are viable to support verification that finished product is successfully sterilized through the (b)(4) Sterilization process. Additionally, the inspection revealed that critical information such as the batch number and expiration date of the BI used in the sterile load is not documented on the post-sterilization B1 Test Reports, which are used as part of the finished device acceptance and release process.\n\n2) Your firm's incoming inspection and acceptance procedure for Sterile Potties (M1421, M1422) used for storing ultrasound cleaned NeoZoline Ventilation Tubes is not adequately established. The inspection revealed that your firm accepts incoming sterile pottle lots without a Certificate of Sterilization from the supplier. (b)(4). Your firm stated that no additional testing or verification is performed to ensure the sterility of the incoming potties. (b)(4)\n\nWe reviewed your firm's response dated June 13, 2024, and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm's response indicates that its Initial Action was completed on June 1, 2024. Your firm concluded that a risk analysis of the specific observation indicates no risk to end users for products currently in distribution and manufacturing. That conclusion is based on the following factors:\n\nThe (b)(4) Biological Indicator is an off the shelf product from supplier where (b)(4) has claimed compliance with ISO 11138-1:2017 and ISO 11138-2:2017.\nThe BI is packaged in a foil pouch designed to protect the product from humidity excursions.\nThe potties are used to store non-sterile Ventilation Tubes hence the sterility of the pottle is not a requirement.\n\nAdditionally, your firm has outlined a plan with the following actions to be completed by December 1, 2024, which includes the following actions:\n\n(b)(4)\n\nBased on your firm's response there is an ambiguity in the definition of the term `pottle' and whether it is required to be sterile or not. (b)(4) your firm's response states that there is no risk for the stenle products manufactured at your facility because the BIs that they use conform to ISO 11138-1:2017 and ISO 11138-2:2017, and that they are in their sterile packaging until they are needed. However, the inspection demonstrated that your firm does not do any testing to verify that the BIs purchased for the purpose of demonstrating that terminal sterilization is achieved, are actually viable when they are used. Additionally, the inspection revealed that they do not capture key data such as BI batch number and expiration date, and thus if a BI falsely indicated that a sterilization was successful, there is no mechanism by which your firm can trace the lots of sterile products back to a failed BI.\n\nAdditionally, your firm did not include documentation or evidence of the corrections or corrective actions because they are in progress and have not been completed. Additionally, given the observations described above, your firm has not provided a commitment to conduct a retrospective assessment of all finished devices whose sterilization was verified using Biological Indicator (b)(4) to determine whether sterility was compromised.\n\n2. Failure to ensure that where the results of a process cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test, the process shall be validated with a high degree of assurance and approved according to established procedures, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(a). For example:\n\n1) Your firm's ultrasonic cleaning process using the (b)(4) Cleaner (b)(4) is not adequately validated according to your firm's Manufacturing Process (b)(4). During the inspection, FDA's investigator revealed that the ultrasonic cleaning process was not adequately validated because critical details—such as the description of the NeoZoline Ventilation Tube (including part number, size, and shape), the number of validation batches (runs), validation batch size, and sample size used—were not documented.\n\n2) During the inspection, your firm stated that it had not validated the (b)(4) process for the NeoZoline Ventilation Tube (b)(4). Your firm stated that the (b)(4).  Adept Medical also confirmed during the inspection that (b)(4) had not validated the NeoZoline Ventilation Tube (b)(4) and that prior to Spring 2023, (b)(4) the NeoZoline Ventilation Tube (b)(4) who also did not have a (b)(4) NeoZoline Ventilation Tube.\n\nWe reviewed your firm's response dated June 13, 2024, and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm's response indicates its Initial Action was completed on June 1, 2024. Your firm concluded that there is no risk to end users for products currently in supply and with distributors, based on the following factors:\n\nThere is an existing validated sterilization process indicating a sterility assurance level of (b)(4)\nAnnual bioburden results of pre-cleaned devices have bioburden levels below (b)(4) CFU.\nCurrent validation data, although not well documented in its sample selection and setting, still indicated the current setting provided adequate bioburden results, well within the capability of the sterilization process.\n\nAdditionally, your firm has outlined a plan to be completed by June 1, 2025, which includes the following actions:\n\n(b)(4)\n\nHowever, your firm has not provided any evidence to substantiate your claims that the (b)(4) sterility assurance level or the bioburden limits below (b)(4) CFU were consistently achievable. The inspection raised concerns about your firm sterilization process, as discussed in the above section regarding compliance with 21 CFR 820.80(a). It is noteworthy that FDA requested validation documents for the (b)(4) Cleaner during the May 2024 inspection and did not receive any documentation to indicate that this process was validated.\n\n3. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action, as required by 21 CFR 820.100. For example:\n\nYour firm's Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) procedure (M05-03) fails to ensure that:\n\n1) The quality data is adequately analyzed to identify potential and existing causes of nonconformances or other quality issues. Your firm stated to the FDA investigator that, although data is analyzed, they do not evaluate the results to determine whether any corrective or preventive actions are necessary, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(3).\n\n2) Your firm failed to adequately verify the effectiveness of corrective actions for several CAPAs before closing them. Specifically, CAPAs CA-459, CA-438, and CA-437 were closed after implementing corrective actions, but your firm did not verify the effectiveness of these actions, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(4).\n\n3) CA-429 was closed on February 16, 2023; at the time of the inspection, your firm stated that they had not started any of the corrective actions identified in the CAPA. As a result of the discussion during the inspection, your firm volunteered to mark the CAPA as 'open,' so that the corrective actions could be implemented.\n\nWe reviewed your firm's response dated June 13, 2024, and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm's response indicates that its Initial Action was completed on May 29, 2024. Your firm concluded that although procedure (b)(4) the procedure did not instruct how to this data should be analyzed, and what subsequent actions should be taken once the data analysis is complete. However, your firm's procedure (b)(4)\n\nYour firm has outlined the following plan to be completed by April 1, 2025, which includes the following actions:\n\n(b)(4)\n\nHowever, your firm's response does not identify conducting a retrospective analysis for all past CAPAs, to determine the impact of the lack of data analysis, and whether the appropriate corrective and/or preventive action was taken to address each CAPA's root cause. Additionally, your firm did not identify what actions it would take to address the lack of implementation of identified corrective actions and whether that issue is a systemic problem.\n\n4. Failure to establish and maintain procedures to control product that does not conform to specified requirements, including the identification, documentation, evaluation, segregation, and disposition of nonconforming product; and failure to ensure that the evaluation includes a determination of the need for an investigation, as required by 21 CFR 820.90(a). For example:\n\nThe FDA investigator reviewed six NC records related to your firm's NeoZoline Ventilation Tubes. All six NC records were closed (NC-2516, NC-2767, NC-2641, NC-2640, NC-2738, NC-2523), but showed the following deficiencies in documentation:\n\nThe NC records did not adequately document the evaluation of the identified nonconformities.\nThe rationale for not conducting related investigations was inadequately documented in all six NC records.\n\nYour firm explained that incoming NeoZoline Ventilation Tubes (b)(4) are not inspected upon arrival. (b)(4). Your firm further stated that they (b)(4). This target achievement was cited as the reason for not taking further action.\n\nWe reviewed your firm's response dated June 13, 2024, and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm's response indicates that its Initial Action was completed on May 29, 2024. Your firm concluded that there is no risk to end users for products currently in supply and with distributors. That conclusion is based on postmarket surveillance data, which shows no product safety or performance complaints since the product's launch. However, a lack of documented safety signals does not ensure that nonconforming product was controlled and not introduced into commerce.\n\nAdditionally, your firm has outlined a plan to be completed by April 1, 2025, which includes the following actions:\n\n(b)(4)\n\nHowever, your firm did not include documentation to demonstrate that it has evaluated or will evaluate all past non-conformances against your new procedure to determine whether additional corrective action was required to address the non-conformances identified in your NC Records.\n\n5. Failure to define the type and extent of control to be exercised over the product, services, suppliers, contractors, and consultants, based on the evaluation results, as required by 21 CFR 820.50(a)(2). For example:\n\nDuring the inspection, your firm was asked whether the (b)(4) for the NeoZoline ventilation tubes was validated (b)(4). Your firm stated you have no knowledge or documentation regarding whether the (b)(4) for the NeoZoline Ventilation Tubes had been properly validated. (b)(4) Adept Medical learned the (b)(4) Adept Medical received (b)(4) units of NeoZoline Ventilation Tubes in various types from (b)(4) between June 2023 and November 2023. They released (b)(4) units ((b)(4) boxes) of the NeoZoline Ventilation Tubes to the United States. Prior to June 2023, all NeoZoline Ventilation Tubes were (b)(4).  Adept has failed to ensure that the conditions of the supplier agreement were adhered to by your supplier.\n\nWe reviewed your firm's response dated June 13, 2024, and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm's response indicates that its Initial Action was completed on May 29, 2024. Your firm concluded that there is no risk to the end users for products currently in supply and with distributors, based on the following considerations:\n\nThe post-market periodic safety update report (PSUR) on Ventilation Tubes supplied by (b)(4) indicated no adverse events.\n(b)(4)\nPost market surveillance data indicated we have had no product safety or performance complaints since product launch.\n\nHowever, a lack of adverse events in post market safety signals does not provide assurance that the device meets its design specifications, in light of the fact that, Adept Medical was unaware that your supplier (b)(4) the NeoZoline Ventilation Tube (b)(4) did not have any documentation that the (b)(4) device was validated.\n\nAdditionally, your firm has outlined a plan to be completed by June 1, 2025, which includes the following actions:\n\n(b)(4)\n\nHowever, based on your firm's response, it is unclear how you intend to evaluate suppliers' compliance with 21 CFR Part 820, the Quality System Regulation.\n\nOur inspection also revealed that the NeoZoline Ventilation Tubes are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PM_A) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). The device is also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the device into commercial distribution, in that your firm did not notify FDA regarding a significant change or modification in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), and 21 C.F.R. 807.81 (a)(3)(i).\n\nSpecifically, your firm has modified the NeoZoline Ventilation Tubes cleared under K061058. The modification involves the use of a (b)(4) which was not cleared in the original submission and is a change that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device. This modification necessitates a comprehensive risk assessment to ensure the device remains safe and effective. A new biocompatibility evaluation is required to determine if (b)(4). Any (b)(4) may affect how the device can be safely and effectively sterilized. Thus, your sterilization processes must be validated for the (b)(4) to ensure that it can be properly sterilized without (b)(4) becoming unsafe. The change in (b)(4) may alter the device's performance or specifications, so a thorough re-evaluation is necessary to ensure it still meets all necessary standards and functions as intended. Due to the (b)(4) modification and its potential impact on the device's safety and performance, a new 510(k) submission is required before marketing the modified device in the United States.\n\nFor a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. [21 CFR 807.81(b)] The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the device is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/d efault.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed.\n\nOther federal agencies may take your compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations into account when considering the award of federal contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been addressed.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to address the noted violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm's planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Please provide a translation of documentation not in English to facilitate our review. We will notify you regarding the adequacy of your firm's response(s) and the need to re-inspect your firm's facility to verify that the appropriate corrections and/or corrective actions have been made. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration as part of your response.\n\nYour firm's response should be sent via email to CDRHWarningLetterResponses@fda.hhs.gov or by mail to Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Office of Regulatory Programs, Division of Regulatory Programs 2, FDA Regulatory Inspections and Audits Team, White Oak Building 66, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993.
