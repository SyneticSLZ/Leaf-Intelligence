We have also reviewed your social media website https://www.instagram.com/fillerlux_usa/, which directs consumers to your https://fillerx.com website to purchase your products. As described below, your “LemonBottle Ampoule Solution,” “Dr. Lipo+,” “Lipo Lab PPC Solution,” “DermaHeal LL,” and “Wonderfit” products are unapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).\n\nThese products are especially concerning from a public health perspective because injectable drug products can pose risks of serious harm to users. Injectable products are delivered directly into the body, sometimes directly into the bloodstream, and therefore, bypass some of the body’s key defenses against toxins and microorganisms that can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions.\n\nYour products are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended to prevent, treat, or cure disease conditions and/or affect the structure or function of the body. Examples of claims observed on your websites that establish the intended use of your products as drugs for human use include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\nLemonBottle Ampoule Solution\n\nOn your webpage https://fillerx.com/products/lemonbottle-lipolysis-solution:\n\n“Lipolysis Solution”\n“Even without Lipase (Hyaluronidase), the lipolytic effect of Lemon Bottle is already excellent.”\n“KEY INGREDIENTS\n1.

This combined substance safely dissolves fat cells through interaction and consequently results in destruction of fat cells or minimizes the size of fat cells.”\n\nDermaHeal LL\n\nOn your webpage https://fillerx.com/products/dermaheal-ll:\n\n“Lipolytic Solution”\n“[T]his fat-dissolving treatment reduces stubborn fat pockets, minimizes cellulite.”\n“Reduces Stubborn Fat: Effectively targets and eliminates localized fat deposits.”\n\nWonderfit\n\nOn your webpage https://fillerrx.com/producs/wonderlift:\n\n“Injectable for localized fat reduction[,] Effectively breaks down adipocyte cells”\n“Usage\nEvery part of the face and body.\nSpecifically where difficult to get removed by exercise and diet”\n\nYour “LemonBottle Ampoule Solution,” “Dr. Lipo+,” “Lipo Lab PPC Solution,” “DermaHeal LL,” and “Wonderfit” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). Subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). No approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355 are in effect for these products. Accordingly, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them.
