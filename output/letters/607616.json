Shah\nDirector and Owner\nAngiplast Private Limited\n\n4803 Phase Iv\nAhmedbad 382445 Gujarat\nIndia\n\nIssuing Office:\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\n\nMay 14, 2020\n\nDear Mr. Shah:\n\nDuring an inspection of your firm located in Ahmedbad, India on January 27, 2020, through January 30, 2020, an investigator from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your firm manufactures urinary drainage bags. Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body.\n\nThis inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\n\nWe received a response from you dated February 14, 2020, concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, which was issued to your firm. We address this response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for acceptance of incoming product, as required by 21 CFR 820.80(b). For example: five of the nine lots of PVC inlet tubes used in class two urinary drain bags did not meet acceptance criteria. The Master Formula Card MCF NO.: C2/40, Issue 1 Revision 4 for the Fig Leaf Cover urinary drain bag shows that the inlet tube must be (b)(4) in length. Batch (b)(4) measured lengths of (b)(4). Batches (b)(4) measured (b)(4). The Master Formula Card MCF NO.: C2/73, Issue 1 Revision 3 for the (b)(4) urinary drain bag shows that the inlet tube must be (b)(4) in length and (b)(4) grams. Batch (b)(4) had a length of (b)(4) mm and measurements of (b)(4) and (b)(4) grams. However, the lots were accepted and subsequently used in finished devices that were released for distribution.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. Your firm’s response indicated that the analyst responsible for incoming inspection accepted the samples of inlet tubing as they were within the tolerance range of finished product specification. Your firm increased the incoming inspection specification tolerance to match the final acceptance specification tolerance (+/- 5 cm). However, the response is not adequate because it does not address why your firm established an incoming inspection criterion tighter than the finished product specifications. Additionally, your firm did not evaluate other incoming inspection specifications to determine whether they were appropriate and whether your firm followed them in practice. Thirdly, your firm did not provide an explanation of why your firm did not identify the product as nonconforming product and how your firm will use its nonconforming product process to address similar issues in the future. Finally, your firm did not review past acceptance records to determine the extent and impact of accepted nonconforming product.\n\n2. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a). For example:\n\na. CAPA procedure, CORRECTIVE ACTION, No. QMPR/8.5.01 Issue 07, Revision 0, does not define how statistical methodology will be employed. Your firm has not employed any statistical methodology to detect recurring quality problems.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. Your firm’s response indicated that your firm revised QMPR/8.5.01 Corrective Action to include statistical methodology as an input source for CAPA. Your firm’s response is not adequate because it is unclear whether your firm implemented the new procedure and performed a statistical analysis of quality data, including retrospective analysis to determine if existing quality problems went undetected. Your firm’s revised CAPA procedure indicates your firm will complete (b)(4). However, the rationale for this decision, including the appropriateness of the sampling frequency, is unclear.\n\nb. CAPA 02/2017-18 was closed without verification of effectiveness and your firm did not subsequently verify the effectiveness of the action.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. Your firm’s response indicated that your firm revised QMPR/8.5.01 Corrective Action to include a justification for failure to validate the effectiveness of a corrective action. Your firm’s response is not adequate because the revised procedure does not ensure that your firm will verify CAPAs to ensure that such action is effective and does not adversely affect the finished device. Instead, the revised procedure requires CAPAs to be closed within (b)(4) days and does not account for corrective actions that may take longer than (b)(4) days to verify effectiveness or provide a mechanism for ensuring the verification of effectiveness is completed and documented.\n\nc. CAPA 07/EA/2017-18 did not include documentation of training for the design change procedure implemented as a result of the CAPA.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. Your firm’s response indicated that your firm discussed CAPA 07/EA/2017-18. However, your firm’s response is not adequate because your firm did not provide information that your firm evaluated other CAPAs to determine if your firm did not document necessary training.\n\n3. Failure to evaluate and select potential suppliers, contractors, and consultants on the basis of their ability to meet specified requirements, including quality requirements, as required by 21 CFR 820.50(a)(1). For example: your firm did not evaluate suppliers outside (b)(4).\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. Your firm’s response indicated your firm did not evaluate foreign suppliers due to the brand reputation and high quality of materials supplied by them. Your firm revised its purchasing procedure QMPR/7.4.01 to remove the exception for branded and imported items. Your firm’s response is not adequate because it did not indicate your firm will conduct supplier evaluations for foreign product and services. Additionally, the response did not indicate your firm will evaluate the risk of finished product produced with uncontrolled supplier components.\n\n4. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for monitoring and control of process parameters for validated processes to ensure that the specified requirements continue to be met, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(b). For example, there was no procedure for calibrating the heat sealer used to (b)(4).\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response and concluded that it is not adequate. Your firm’s response indicated that your firm used the master temperature controller (which is calibrated) for validation of the sealing process. Your firm subsequently calibrated the temperature controller of all heat sealers. Your firm’s response is not adequate because your firm did not evaluate other validated processes and ensured that it has established procedures for monitoring and controlling process parameters.\n\nU.S. federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation deviations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective action (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Please provide a translation of documentation not in English to facilitate our review. We will notify you regarding the adequacy of your firm’s response(s) and the need to re-inspect your firm’s facility to verify that the appropriate corrections and/or corrective actions have been made.\n\nYour firm’s response should be sent to: Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Office of Regulatory Programs, Division of Regulatory Programs 2, FDA Inspections and Regulatory Audits Team, White Oak Building 66, Rm 3540, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993. Refer to CMS case #607616 when replying. If you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Andrew Durfor at 301-796-7036 or Andrew.Durfor@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n/S/\n\nBenjamin R.
