Additionally, we reviewed product listings on your Amazon storefront at https://www.amazon.com/s?i=merchant-items&me=A3S4W2SM9FX1BR, which you operate under the name, HFL - Dr Sam Robbins Official Store.\n\nAlthough you label and promote CholesLo as a dietary supplement, laboratory analyses of two samples collected by the FDA determined that this product contains lovastatin. Lovastatin is the active ingredient in Mevacor® and its generic counterparts, which are FDA-approved drugs used to treat patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. The first sample contained approximately 14.3 mg per capsule. If taken at the maximum dose recommended on the label, your product would provide 85.8 mg lovastatin per day, which is above the maximum recommended daily dose of lovastatin in Mevacor and its generic counterparts. The second sample contained approximately 0.4141 mg per capsule. If taken at the maximum dose recommended on the label, your product would provide 2.48 mg lovastatin per day, which is less than half the recommended daily dose of lovastatin in Mevacor and its generic counterparts.\n\nFDA has issued a warning to consumers not to use “CholesLo” (see the “CholesLo” Immediate Public Notification) as a result of the lab analyses finding lovastatin in your products.\n\nTraditional red yeast rice does not contain more than trace amounts of lovastatin, if any. Because your CholesLo product contains red yeast rice with enhanced or added lovastatin, it cannot be marketed as a dietary supplement. Section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(i)] specifically excludes from the dietary supplement definition articles that are approved as new drugs under section 505, unless the article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a new drug. FDA approved Mevacor® as a new drug on August 31, 1987; neither lovastatin as a single ingredient, nor any red yeast rice product manufactured and promoted for lovastatin content, was marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before that date. FDA’s conclusions that lovastatin’s approval as a new drug preceded its marketing as a food or dietary supplement and that a lovastatin-enhanced red yeast rice product is not a dietary supplement were upheld in litigation involving a product called Cholestin. Pharmanex, Inc. v. Shalala, 221 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir. 2000); 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4598 (D. Utah Mar. 30, 2001) (district court opinion on remand).\n\nIn addition to analyzing your products, we have reviewed your websites, including your social media websites, and Amazon storefront webpage as noted in the beginning of this letter, and have determined that claims on your labels and websites establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) and 201(g)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. §§ 321(g)(1)(B) and 321(g)(1)(C)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or function of the human body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n\nCholesLo\n\nExamples of some of the website and product label claims that provide evidence that your CholesLo product is intended for use as a drug include:\n\nOn your product label of CholesLo:\n• “Promotes Healthy Cholesterol Levels”\n• “Supports Balanced HDL/LDL Ratios”\n• “WHY CholesLo™ Is Better? . . . One of the primary causes of high cholesterol, is the change in your hormones due to aging. CholesLo™ is our best solution on the market”\n\nOn your website https://my.4hfl.com/choleslo:\n• In your video embedded on the webpage,\n  o “NATURALLY improve your cholesterol levels from within . . . The ingredients in CholesLo™ are clinically proven… to help… 1. Create healthy cholesterol levels. 2. Optimize your HDL/LDL ratios…. 4. [R]epair your LIVER… 6. Naturally lower blood sugar levels and total-body ‘inflammation’.”\n  o “CholesLo™ . . . it’s a COMPLETE solution that focuses on ALL the potential… …causes of heart disease”\n  o “In fact, if CholesLo™ doesn’t help lower your total cholesterol by 30 pts in only 30 days . . . I’ll give you a full refund . . . I can make such a guarantee . . . because I’ve seen CholesLo™ work for over 12 years”\n• “Most likely you’re reading this because you’re interested in improving your cholesterol and lipid levels naturally . . . CholesLo’s 20+ year proven formula can help you achieve healthy cholesterol and balanced lipid levels.”\n• “CholesLo™ also helps reduce inflammation – a major leading factor of many health problems, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.”\n• “The reason I formulated CholesLo™ in 1998 for my parents, was because they were having too many negative side-effects from their prescription, cholesterol lowering ‘statin’ drugs.”\n\nOn your website https://www.choleslo.drsamrobbins.com/sub/research.php:\n• You provide a chart titled, “CholesLo’s Average 30-Day Improvements,” and several graphs including, “Average Cholesterol Improved In 8 Weeks = 46 pts (19%),” “Randomized Double-Blind Study Average Percentage (%) Of Lipids Improved in 20 Weeks,” and “Average LDL Improved in 21 Days = 8.9%,” which indicate that your product is intended for use in lowering cholesterol levels.\n\nOn your website https://www.choleslo.drsamrobbins.com/sub/ingredients.php:\n• “‘The combination of red yeast rice extract and policosanols [ingredients in your product CholesLo] is both safe and effective in the treatment of hypercholesterolomic children . . . significantly reduce cholesterolemia and achieved acceptable plasma LDL-C levels in elderly hypercholesterolemic patients.’”\n• “If you have high LDL cholesterol levels, garlic [an ingredient in your product CholesLo] supplementation is especially important because LDL cholesterol oxidation causes atherosclerosis . . . Most importantly, garlic prevents abnormal platelet aggregation (thrombosis) via several different mechanisms. The formation of arterial blood clots is the primary cause of most heart attacks and strokes.”\n• “The discovery that artichoke leaf extract [an ingredient in your product CholesLo] reduces elevated cholesterol levels opens up exciting perspectives in the prevention and treatment of arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease.”\n• “Because of their ability to block dietary cholesterol absorption, phytosterols [an ingredient in your product CholesLo] can help lower your cholesterol levels. In the last few years, clinical research has also discovered other effects, including reducing symptoms of an enlarged prostate, improving the control of blood sugar among people with diabetes, and reducing inflammation among patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.”\n\nWe also reviewed your websites and determined that you take orders there for AlphaViril, Blood Flow Optimizer, Blood Pressure Optimizer, Blood Sugar Optimizer, CHEATmeals, Inflame & Pain Relief, LeanOptimizer, Perfect Vitamin D & K, and ProVanax, which your websites promote for conditions that cause the products to be drugs under sections 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)]. The claims on your websites establish that these products are drugs because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\nInflame & Pain Relief\n\nOn your websites https://my.4hfl.com/inflame-pain-relief/ and https://inflamepainrelief.com:\n• “It’s doctor formulated to naturally help lower the 14 Primary inflammatory & pain triggers in the body”\n• “In fact, inflammation is linked to . . . arthritis[,] . . . heart disease (heart attacks & strokes)[,] obesity[,] . . . cancer and auto-immune diseases[,] . . . brain aging (dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, etc.)[,] . . . diabetes & high blood sugar[,] allergies & asthma”\n\nOn your website https://www.inflamepainrelief.com/sub/ingredients.php:\n• “[D]elays or even reverses many brain diseases and age-related decreases in brain function, including Alzheimer’s disease.”\n• “Lowers Heart Disease . . .

Also known as Vitamin D [an ingredient in your product Perfect Vitamin D & K].”\n\n• In a video embedded on this webpage, which is also posted to your YouTube channel at the website www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRyiWHDd66Q with the hashtag, #cancer,\n  o “This steroid is extremely powerful at improving your health, while also reducing diseases and different forms of cancer, by as much as 50%”\n  o “Reduces inflammation”\n  o “Improves blood sugar levels”\n  o “So do yourself a favor and make sure you get some extra Vitamin D . . . helping to reduce illnesses, diseases, and cancer.”\n• “Benefits Of This Steroid: . . . reduce hip fractures by 75%[,] Dramatically improves your immune system by reducing colds and flus[,] Reduces depression . . .

Examples of such testimonials include:\n\nOn your website https://reviews.4hfl.com/select.php:\n• “It was a full year between blood tests and the entire time I was taking CholesLo five days each week, six pills per day.

I ordered in two bottles [of CholesLo], one for myself, and one for my husband. We followed the bottle directions each week. Three weeks later . . . The number was 226. My bad cholesterol had come down to 126. Unbelievable! That is a drop of 72 points in the LDL (bad) cholesterol. We would recommend this product to everyone for high cholesterol.”\n• “My son-in-law takes it [Provanax] also, for ADHD.”\n\nWhen scientific references are used commercially by the seller of a product to promote the product to consumers, such references may become evidence of the product’s intended use. For example, under 21 CFR 101.93(g)(2)(iv)(C), a citation of a publication or reference in the labeling of a dietary supplement is considered to be a claim about disease treatment or prevention if the citation refers to a disease use, and if, in the context of the labeling as a whole, the citation implies treatment or prevention of a disease. Your websites provide the following publications reporting the results of studies pertaining to the use of CholesLo and its ingredients for the prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular diseases:\n\nOn your websites https://my.4hfl.com/choleslo and https://choleslo.drsamrobbins.com/sub/research.php:\n• “Cholesterol-Lowering Abilities of a Novel Proprietary Preparation CholesLo™ -A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.”\n\nOn your website https://www.inflamepainrelief.com/sub/ingredients.php:\n• “Sime S, Reeve VE.

I’ll also reveal the exact formula my dad used to lower his blood pressure by 23% in just a few days . . . https://www.drsamrobbins.com/blood-pressure/a-clinically-proven-way-to-lower-your-blood-pressure-in-only-30-days-using-grape-seed-extract/ . . . #lowerbloodpressure”\n\nOn your Twitter social media website, https://www.twitter.com/drsamrobbins,\n• On a March 28, 2020 post: “Ginger [an ingredient in your Blood Flow Optimizer product] is an amazing inflammatory and a great substitute to aspirin!

I have a family history of heart attacks and strokes so I formulated a natural remedy that can improve your blood flow in only 30-days. drsam.co/s/TW/ImproveBl…”\n\nOn an October 28, 2019 YouTube video titled, “WARNING: Prostate cancer is linked to LOW testosterone! New Research – by Dr Sam Robbins,” posted with your YouTube account, Men’s Health by Dr. Sam Robbins, on the website https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Iukbm-DT_Q:\n• In the video: “LOW testosterone is the REAL health risk in prostate cancer . . . So today you’ll discover the REAL cause AND cure for prostate cancer . . . Now, for decades scientists have give men with prostate cancer, anti-androgen drugs such as Flutamide . . . In fact, increasing your testosterone levels . . . Is the REAL CURE for prostate cancer!”\n• In the video description:\n  o “Here's my favorite, scientifically proven formula for increasing your testosterone ONLY with natural ingredients” and you provide a link to your AlphaViril website, https://alphaviril.com, where you take orders for your product AlphaViril.\n  o “In fact, one study included 18 total studies involving almost 20,000 men and it showed that increasing testosterone helped protect against prostate cancer.”\n\nFurthermore, you operate an Amazon storefront under the name, HFL - Dr Sam Robbins Official Store. We reviewed your product listings for Blood Flow Optimizer, CHEATmeals, and LeanOptimizer. The product descriptions on these listings provide evidence that these products are intended for use as drugs include the following:\n\nOn the Blood Flow Optimizer webpage, https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/EF3755F8-FFDE-4688-B985-BCC411AB8C1A:\n• “Nattokinase [an ingredient in your Blood Flow Optimizer product] is by nature a blood thinner”\n• “Ginger [an ingredient in your Blood Flow Optimizer product] boasts anti-inflammatory properties that position it as an effective substitute for aspirin. Well documented for helping to prevent blood clots, its [sic] also been known to fight against atherosclerosis which can ultimately help to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke.”\n• “Green Tea Extract [an ingredient in your Blood Flow Optimizer product] . . . linked to managing blood pressure”\n• “White Willow Extract [an ingredient in your Blood Flow Optimizer product] contains salicin, a natural blood thinner and anti-inflammatory.”\n• “Aging causes poor blood flow to the brain, which means less oxygen resulting in memory & cognitive problems, even Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. The good news is that you can now reverse this ‘aging problem’, naturally.”\n\nOn the Blood Flow Optimizer product listing:\n• “Decrease the plaque buildup”\n• “Strengthen the walls of the arteries and blood vessels, reducing the chance of a rupture or tear.”\n• “Inhibit future buildup of plaque and calcium, which can help prevent a heart attack or stroke.”\n\nOn the CHEATmeals product listing:\n• “Lower Bad Cholesterol, LDL and Triglycerides”\n• “Normalize Blood Sugar and Glucose Levels”\n\nOn the LeanOptimizer product listing:\n• “Helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels”\n\nYour AlphaViril, Blood Flow Optimizer, Blood Pressure Optimizer, Blood Sugar Optimizer, CHEATmeals, CholesLo, Inflame & Pain Relief, LeanOptimizer, Perfect Vitamin D & K, and ProVanax products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour products AlphaViril, Blood Flow Optimizer, Blood Pressure Optimizer, Blood Sugar Optimizer, CHEATmeals, CholesLo, Inflame & Pain Relief, LeanOptimizer, Perfect Vitamin D & K, and ProVanax are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, AlphaViril, Blood Flow Optimizer, Blood Pressure Optimizer, Blood Sugar Optimizer, CHEATmeals, CholesLo, Inflame & Pain Relief, LeanOptimizer, Perfect Vitamin D & K, and ProVanax fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)].\n\nThe introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nYou should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nWithin fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations.

If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
