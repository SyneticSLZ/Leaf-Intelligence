The claims on your websites establish the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\nDr. Miller’s Holy Tea and Super Holy Tea products\n\n“[H]elp relieve digestive ailments such as Acid Reflux (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's Disease, Diverticulitis, Colitis”\n“[A]id in reducing high LDL cholesterol and hypertension”\n“[R]emove parasites such as worms and flukes from the colon”\n“End constipation...and hemorrhoids”\n\nDr. Miller’s Ultimate Tea\n\n“The Ultimate Tea may be beneficial for:... (Constipation… Acid Reflux), Lowers High Blood Pressure, Lowers Cholesterol ... Helps Spastic Colon, Helps Crohn’s Disease”\n“[B]eneficial for: Detoxifies ( … Parasites, Bacteria…)”\n\nDr Miller’s Be Free Spring Clean Herbal Detox\n\n“[R]emoves … Flukes, Mold, Parasites, Viruses, and Bacteria.”\n\nDr Miller’s Youthin Fatburners\n\n“Regular use of Youthin Fat Burners may help control High Blood Pressure and Cholesterol”\n\nYour website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of Dr. Miller’s Holy Tea for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:\n\n“[H]as had terrible migraines for the past 10 years… After a couple of months drinking Dr. Miller's Tea, he no longer has the migraines.”\n“I used to have terrible knife-like sharp pains in my stomach from the Crohn's and IBS, and a great deal of discomfort from the acid reflux. Dr. Miller's Holy Tea has cleared all of this up….”\n“[A]nd no longer have the bloating and acid reflux I was having.”\n\nYour products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour products Dr. Miller’s Holy Tea, Dr. Miller’s Super Holy Tea, Dr. Miller’s Ultimate Tea, and Dr Miller’s Youthin Fatburners are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Dr. Miller’s Holy Tea, Dr. Miller’s Super Holy Tea, Dr. Miller’s Ultimate Tea, and Dr Miller’s Youthin Fatburners fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour reply should be addressed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; Attn: Christopher N. Dedeaux, Compliance Officer, via email at ORAHAFEAST5FirmResponses@fda.hhs.gov or at 404 BNA Drive, Suite 500, Nashville, TN 37217. You may reach Mr. Dedeaux at 504-846-6122 or via email at Christopher.Dedeaux@fda.hhs.gov if you have any questions about this matter.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nSteven B. Barber\nDirector, Division V\nOffice of Human and Animal Foods Operations-East",
