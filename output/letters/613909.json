We also reviewed your website https://healthyinformation.com and your social media website https://facebook.com/phoenixnutritionalsinc/, where you direct consumers to your website https://phoenixvitamins.com to purchase your products. In addition, we observed that the product Best Immune Support is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191 in people. The claims on your websites establish that the products High Vitality Full Spectrum Liquid Multi-Vitamin, High Vitality Caps, Best Cholesterol Support, Blood Sugar Support, Maximum Stress Support, Complete Joint Support, Natural Anti-Inflammatory Support, and Best Immune Support are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\n1) High Vitality FULL SPECTRUM Liquid Multi-Vitamin and High Vitality Caps (collectively, the “High Vitality products”)\n\nOn your website https://healthyinformation.com:\n\nFrom your “Special Report” titled, “Antioxidants & Free Radical Damage,” which includes “SHOP NOW” buttons that link to the High Vitality Full Spectrum Liquid Multi-Vitamin and the High Vitality Caps product pages of your website https://phoenixvitamins.com:\n\n- “…Vitamin A [an ingredient in your High Vitality products] is vital in all disorders of both chronic and acute intestinal inflammations. There is some evidence that Vitamin A exercises anti-cancer effects as well. This would be especially true for those areas where mucous membrane tissue may be found. One study involving over 300 people who underwent surgery for Lung Cancer, found that the group who took very high amounts of Vitamin A had far fewer new tumors than people who did not use the vitamin.”\n- “Other specific sites within the body, which are protected by Vitamin C [an ingredient in your High Vitality products] include the Pancreas, the Lungs and the Prostate Gland, preventing cross linkage of these tissues. This greatly reduces the risk of Cancer in these sites.”\n- “Further, Vitamin E [an ingredient in your High Vitality products] actually helps to lower overall Cholesterol and Triglycerides in the bloodstream. Vitamin E is a natural blood thinner and helps to prevent fats, naturally occurring in the blood, from sticking together.

Lastly, Bilberry helps diminish inflammation, a helpful effect in such conditions as Arthritis and other inflammatory disorders…it is very good for wound healing.

Anyone suffering from any form of Hepatitis MUST consider Milk Thistle as part of their treatment and management program.”\n- “Among the many direct benefits of ALA [an ingredient in your High Vitality Full Spectrum Liquid Multi-Vitamin], one of the most important is its ability to protect the body against the ravages of excess insulin as found in all Hyperinsulinemia conditions, which include most Obesity, …Hypoglycemia and of course, Type II Diabetes.”\n- “ALA [an ingredient in your High Vitality Full Spectrum Liquid Multi-Vitamin] can help to reduce and regulate Cholesterol levels, exercising a lowering effect on Cholesterol by as much as 40 percent.”\n- “Other important functions of ALA [an ingredient in your High Vitality Full Spectrum Liquid Multi-Vitamin] include protecting the body against specific types of Cancers ...”\n- “Lutein [an ingredient in your High Vitality Full Spectrum Liquid Multi-Vitamin] was shown to almost completely prevent this Free Radical Activity from invading the cells of the Macula, thereby controlling and preventing Macular Degeneration.”\n\nFrom your “Special Report” titled, “Preventing & Reversing Heart Disease”:\n\n- “CoQ10 [an ingredient in your High Vitality products] actually reduces angina . . .”\n\n2) Best Cholesterol Support\n\nOn the Best Cholesterol Support product page of your website https://phoenixvitamins.com:\n\n- “Regardless of your viewpoint on the subject, it is generally agreed that excess cholesterol in the blood is not a healthy situation.

Below this claim is an audio file titled, “Your Immunity During These Times of Corona Virus.”]\n\nOn your Facebook Page at https://facebook.com/phoenixnutritionalsinc/, from a Facebook post, dated 11/5/2020:\n\n- “The next few months will be among the highest for cases of Covid-19 as the next wave of the virus spreads across the country. We can already see this taking place in Europe and in parts of the U.S. For this reason, we wanted to let you know that we are advising everyone to take our Immune Support Formula at least through the end of January. We have just received a fresh supply of this powerful formula and it’s ready for immediate shipment. Order online at: https://phoenixvitamins.com/product/best-immune-support/”\n\nYour High Vitality Full Spectrum Liquid Multi-Vitamin, High Vitality Caps, Best Cholesterol Support, Blood Sugar Support, Maximum Stress Support, Complete Joint Support, Natural Anti-Inflammatory Support, and Best Immune Support products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour High Vitality Full Spectrum Liquid Multi-Vitamin, High Vitality Caps, Best Cholesterol Support, Blood Sugar Support, Maximum Stress Support, Complete Joint Support, Natural Anti-Inflammatory Support, and Best Immune Support products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, High Vitality Full Spectrum Liquid Multi-Vitamin, High Vitality Caps, Best Cholesterol Support, Blood Sugar Support, Maximum Stress Support, Complete Joint Support, Natural Anti-Inflammatory Support, and Best Immune Support products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products.

It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations.

The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19. Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell a product that is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.",
