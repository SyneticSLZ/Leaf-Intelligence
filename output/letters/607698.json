Wicklow\nIreland\n\n ronan.ocaoimh@trinitybiotech.com\nIssuing Office:\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nUnited States\n\n\n\nOffice of Medical Device and Radiological Health Division 2\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\nCMS # 607698\n\nAugust 12, 2020\n\nDear Mr. O’Caomigh,\n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your firm’s device operations at Primus Corporation dba Trinity Biotech, located at 4231 E 75th Terrace, Kansas City, MO, USA, from 01/27 – 02/06/2020. During the inspection, FDA investigators determined that your firm is the manufacturer of ultra2 Resolution Variants System, which consists of the ultra2 Resolution Variants Analyzer and consumables indicated for use with the Analyzer. Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nOur inspection revealed that the ultra2 Resolution Variants System is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). The device is also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the device into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. [21 CFR 807.81(b)]\n\nSpecifically, evidence collected in the 2018 and 2020 inspections indicate that the ultra2 Resolution Variants System is a new device, created by making significant changes to the PVS99 cleared under K955283. For example, your firm made changes to the analytical column, the main component of the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. These changes include a (b)(4). A (b)(4) for the analytical column is expected to change the resolution capabilities of the System, which is considered a significant change in System performance. Evidence also indicates a change in the sample analysis time for the “QuickScan mode,” from 5.5 minutes for the PVS99 to (b)(4) for the ultra2 Resolution Variants System. Changes in sample analysis time, which can be due to faster column flow rates or reduced HPLC column length, can directly affect peak resolution and sensitivity (limit of detection) for the System. These changes represent significant modifications that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device such that a new 510(k) premarket notification must be submitted [see 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)(i)].\n\nIn addition, we note that evidence collected in the 2020 inspection states that the ultra2 Resolution Variants System can detect and “presumptively” identify hemoglobin variants for which the PVS99 510(k) submission did not include supporting data, including HbS, HbC, HbE, and HbD-Los Angeles. The data supporting the System’s clearance, and upon which the clearance was based, demonstrated identification only of hemoglobin variants HbA2 and HbF. Statements that the System can identify hemoglobin variants HbS, HbC, HbE, and HbD-Los Angeles may constitute a major change in the intended use of the PVS99 system and may raise serious public health concerns if the System cannot accurately and reliably perform as stated. For example, patients with sickle cell disease, and other hemoglobinopathies, who are not appropriately identified by the System could have delayed treatment which could have significantly negative health consequences, such as severe anemia that can damage tissue or cause death, or a life-threatening pneumococcal infection. In addition, patients who are misidentified as having a hemoglobinopathy may suffer negative health consequences from inappropriate prophylactic treatment.\n\nEvidence collected in the inspection demonstrates that you are continuing to distribute modified analytical columns to customers. As of May 20, 2020, your U.S.-facing website indicates that the ultra2 Resolution Variants Analyzer is an “FDA cleared” system (https://www.trinitybiotech.com/products/ultra2-resolution-variants-analyzer-2/ ). We note that this statement may create the false or misleading impression that FDA has cleared the new device with the significant changes described above.\n\nFor a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the FDA [21 CFR 807.81(b)]. The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the devices is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed.\n\nThe inspection also revealed that your devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at 21 CFR part 820. We received a response from your Quality Assurance Manager, Britt Einspahr, dated February 27, 2020 concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), Inspectional Observations, which was issued on February 6, 2020. We address the response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. Violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to establish procedures for design change, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(i).\n\nSpecifically, your firm has not validated changes to your ultra2 Resolution variant hemoglobin analysis system, related changes from the (b)(4) to the (b)(4), or from the 3 μm analysis column to a 5 μm analysis column.\n\nYour response to this observation is inadequate. Although you have updated your design control procedure, your response does not include a plan to thoroughly evaluate missing validations for any or all of the changes to this device design.\n\n2. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for verifying the device design to confirm that the design output meets the device input requirements, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(f).\n\nSpecifically, the design verification for your Premier HbA1c device does not demonstrate that your design outputs meet all inputs. There requirements related to sample volumes for off-line dilution (b)(4), time to first result (b)(4), and acceptable maintenance time were not verified (b)(4).\n\nYour response to this observation is inadequate. Your response includes documentation related to the examples from the FDA 483. However, the rationale behind the sample size (b)(4) and the testing frequency (b)(4) has not been provided. Further, there is no established plan for reviewing that your design outputs confirm your design inputs for this device.\n\n3. Risk Analysis is inadequate, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(g).\n\nSpecifically, your firm’s procedure for risk analysis, Risk Management 7.1 QAQP13, Revision 5 has not been established. For example, your procedure does not define how the “Severity of Residual Risk” section will be determined. Additionally, two hazards from your Risk Management Report for the Premier HB9210 HbA1c Analyzer were not consistently rated for severity rating.\n\nYour response to this observation is inadequate. Your response does not provide a detailed plan of how your firm will conduct a thorough review of your risk analysis for either your Premier HB HB9210 HbA1c Analyzer or your ultra2 Resolution Variants Analyzer.\n\nYour firm should take prompt action to correct the device and other violations addressed in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. Also, should FDA determine that your devices do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted. More information on processes for persons denied a CFG can be found at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/process-request-review-fdas-decision-not-issue-certain-export-certificates-devices. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, please respond to FDA with your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter.\n\nIf you have questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact Compliance Officer, Andrea Norwood at (407) 475-4724 or at andrea.norwood@fda.hhs.gov. Please send your reply electronically to Melissa Michurski, Director of Compliance Branch, at oradevices2firmresponse@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the FDA 483 issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nBlake Bevill, MS\nProgram Division Director\nOffice of Medical Device and Radiological Health\nDivision 2\n\n/S/\n\nDonald St. Pierre\nDeputy Director, New Product Evaluation\nOn behalf of-\nTimothy Stenzel, M.D., Ph,D.
