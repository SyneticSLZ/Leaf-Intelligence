The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your firm’s Facebook account in October and November 2024 where you direct customers to your product on Amazon and Only Natural Pet Store and has determined that you offer your product for sale there.\n\nBased on our review of your Facebook account and third-party webpages, your product is a drug under section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)], because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. This product is an unapproved new animal drug and introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nYou can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\n\nThe intended use of your “Seizures” product is indicated by its name and is also shown by the claims you make for it. Examples of claims FDA observed on your product labelling, Facebook account and third-party webpages to which you direct your customers that show the intended use of your product include the following:\n\nFrom your Facebook post titled “Doc Ackerman's Pet Products” at the URL https://www.facebook.com/p/Doc-Ackermans-Pet-Products-100057232281085/?_rdr dated April 14:\n\n• “Epilepsy & Seizure Formula… Remedies for Dogs and Cats”\n• “… The Epilepsy and Seizure formula will be available at the end of April on Amazon and at Only Natural Pet Store.”\n\nFrom your product webpage “Doc Ackerman's - Epilepsy & Seizure Formula” on Amazon at the URL https://www.amazon.com/Doc-Ackermans-Epilepsy-Seizure-Formula/dp/B0002CGUP0:\n\n• “Epilepsy & Seizure Formula… Remedies for Dogs and Cats”\n• “EPILEPSY AND SEIZURE FORMULA for dogs and cats works as a calmative to help lessen the effects of nervous conditions.”\n• “…is an anti convulsant [sic] & antispasmodic herb … specifically for Epilepsy.”\n• “… help lessen the effects of nervous conditions while acting as a natural tranquilizer,…”\n• “… Safe for your pet …”\n\nFrom your product webpage “DOC ACKERMAN'S EPILEPSY & SEIZURE FORMULA HERBAL REMEDY POWDER FOR DOGS & CATS - 10 OZ” on onlynaturalpet.com at the URL https://www.onlynaturalpet.com/products/doc-ackermans-epilepsy-seizure-formula-herbal-remedy-powder-for-dogs-cats:\n\n• “Epilepsy & Seizure Formula… Remedies for Dogs and Cats”\n• “… Epilepsy & Seizure Formula\n• “…CAT AND DOG SEIZURE TREATMENT HOME REMEDY…”\n• “… Epilepsy and Seizure Formula… provides dogs and cats relief from the effects of epilepsy...”\n• “… natural remedy for dog seizures… to treat epilepsy….”\n• “... natural remedy for dog seizures… safe for your pet and for the environment….”\n• “… seizure remedy comes in a convenient powder form…”\n\nThis product is a new animal drug under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. 321(v)], because it is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.\n\nTo be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. This product is not approved or index listed by FDA, and therefore, the product is unsafe within the meaning of section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)], and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated drug is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all the requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to address this matter may lead to legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.\n\nWithin fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations.
