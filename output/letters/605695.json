Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1.\n\nPlease be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the Act. These products include, but are not limited to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including e- cigarettes), e-liquids, cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685.\n\nA Tobacco Product with Packaging Without the Required Nicotine Warning Statement Is Misbranded\n\nFDA’s inspection of your establishment revealed that packages for your Cloud Concepts – Narcissist e-liquid product, which you manufacture, package, sell, offer to sell, distribute, and/or import for sale or distribution into the United States, do not include the nicotine warning statement required by 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(a). Under 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(a), packages for cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and covered tobacco products (other than cigars), such as e-liquid products, must bear the following warning statement:\n\nWARNING: This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\n\nFor cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and covered tobacco products other than cigars, it is unlawful for any person to manufacture, package, sell, offer to sell, distribute, or import for sale or distribution in the United States such product unless such tobacco product package bears the required warning statement on the package label (21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(a)(1)). Under 21 C.F.R. § 1143.1, a “covered tobacco product” is defined as any tobacco product deemed to be subject to the FD&C Act under 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2, excluding components or parts not made or derived from tobacco. The e-liquid product whose packages do not contain the required nicotine warning statement is a “covered tobacco products.” Under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)), tobacco products are misbranded if sold or distributed in violation of regulations prescribed under section 906(d) of the FD&C Act, including those within 21 C.F.R. Part 1143. Because your Cloud Concepts – Narcissist e-liquid product does not include the required nicotine warning statement on its packages, in violation of 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(a), it is misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)).\n\nIn addition, a tobacco product is misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Under section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in determining whether labeling and/or advertising is misleading, the agency considers, among other things, the failure to reveal material facts concerning the consequences that may result from the customary or usual use of the product.\n\nBecause the product packages for your Cloud Concepts – Narcissist e-liquid product do not include the required nicotine warning statement, it is misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)). The doing of any act with respect to a tobacco product while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product being misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)).\n\nA Tobacco Product Without Required Ingredient Listing Submission Is Misbranded\n\nFDA has determined that you have not provided an ingredient listing to FDA as required by section 904(a)(1). Section 904(a)(1) requires each tobacco product manufacturer or importer, or agents thereof to provide “a listing of all ingredients, including tobacco, substances, compounds, and additives that are… added by the manufacturer to the tobacco, paper filter, or other part of each tobacco product by brand and by quantity in each brand and sub-brand.”\n\nBecause you have not provided FDA with an ingredient listing, FDA has determined that Cloud Concepts – Narcissist e-liquid product, which MVS Richardson, LLC d/b/a Metro Vapors Mesquite manufactures and distributes to customers in the United States, is misbranded under section 903(a)(10)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387d(a)(1) because you failed to comply with requirements prescribed under section 904 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. §387d). The doing of any act with respect to a tobacco product while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product being misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). In addition, the failure to provide any information required by section 904 is a prohibited act under section 301(q)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(q)(1)(B)).\n\nTobacco Products Manufactured in an Establishment Not Duly Registered Are Misbranded\n\nFDA has determined that all e-liquid products manufactured by MVS Richardson, LLC d/b/a Metro Vapors Mesquite are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because they have been manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed in an establishment not duly registered under section 905(b). Specifically, you are required to register your establishment engaged in these activities on or before December 31 of each year pursuant to section 905(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(b)). You registered your sole manufacturing establishment located at 2411 North Galloway Avenue, Suite 116, Mesquite, TX 75150-4854 with the FDA on November 17, 2017, but have failed to submit your annual establishment registration since that date. The doing of any act with respect to a tobacco product while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product being misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). The failure to register your establishment in accordance with section 905 is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)).\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the ones stated above and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the type described above may result in FDA’s taking regulatory action.
