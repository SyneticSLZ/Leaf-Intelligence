Edior-Gustafson\nGrow God, LLC\n\n5792 Dogwood Street\nSan Bernadino, CA 92404-7211\nUnited States\n\n Growgod.orders@gmail.com\nIssuing Office:\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\n\n\nRE: 674690\n\nDear Mr. Gustafson and Mrs. Edior-Gustafson:    \n\nThis letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address growgod.org in February and March 2024, and has determined that you take orders there for various food products, which you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). FDA has determined that your Medicated Funyuns – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Doritos – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Infused Gushers – GrowGod™ Delta-8, and Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Crunchy – GrowGod™ Delta-8 products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. It is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).\n\nAs explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.    \n\nFDA has observed a proliferation of products containing the cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.\n\nFDA is particularly concerned that your products are in forms (candy and chips) that are appealing to children, that mimic well-known snack food brands by using similar brand names, logos, or pictures on packaging, and that consumers may confuse with traditional foods. Therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of the Delta-8 THC ingredient by consumers. In June 2022, FDA warned consumers about the accidental ingestion by children of food products containing THC.1  From January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023, FDA received over 300 adverse event reports describing children and adults who consumed Delta-8 THC products. Nearly half of the reports involved hospitalization or emergency department visits, and approximately two-thirds described adverse events after ingestion of Delta-8 THC-containing food products such as candy or brownies. Your Medicated Funyuns – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Doritos – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Infused Gushers – GrowGod™ Delta-8, and Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Crunchy – GrowGod™ Delta-8 products are all in forms that may be attractive to children and could easily be mistaken for traditional foods that are commonly consumed by children.  \n\nAdulterated Human Foods\n\nAccording to your product labeling, your Medicated Funyuns – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Doritos – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Infused Gushers – GrowGod™ Delta-8, and Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Crunchy – GrowGod™ Delta-8 products are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added. \n\nAs defined in section 201(s) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term \"food additive\" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.2    \n\nFood additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). \n\nThere is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).\n\nWe know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in conventional food does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.  \n\nFDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act. Therefore, your Medicated Funyuns – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Doritos – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Infused Gushers – GrowGod™ Delta-8, and Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Crunchy – GrowGod™ Delta-8 products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). \n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nWe also offer the following comment:\n\nWe note that your firm sells food products that contain cannabinoids other than Delta-8 THC. We know of no basis to conclude that any use in food of a cannabinoid, plant derived or otherwise, would be safe and lawful.  For some cannabinoids, such as Delta-8 THC, the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm. For other cannabinoids, there is little or no available information concerning the safety of their use in food. No cannabinoid, plant derived or otherwise, is approved for any use in food as a food additive. Moreover, we know of no basis to conclude that any intended use in food of any cannabinoid satisfies the criteria for eligibility for GRAS status.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. \n\nYour response should be sent to CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please include “CMS 674690” in the subject line of your email.\n\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\nAnn M. Oxenham                                           \nDirector                                  \nOffice of Compliance\nCenter for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition \nFood and Drug Administration\n\n\ncc:\nJamiel Gustafson\nRhonda V.
