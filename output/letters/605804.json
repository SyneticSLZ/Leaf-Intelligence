Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).\n\nThere is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.2  In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.3  Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.    \n\nSome examples of the claims on your websites that establish the intended use of your products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:\n\n•    “We offer immunity building protocols and treatments that may help during the spread of the COVID-19 virus. These include:\no    Vitamin D3-K2\nThe immune system uses vitamin D to make antimicrobial weapons that puncture holes in …viruses. \no    Liquid Silver\nColloidal Silver has been a very effective way to kill …virus[es] … for many years.\no    Power Immune\nWe have used this blend for many years at the Center for New Medicine. This blend contains Echinacea, Berberine, Elderberry, and Agaricus. It has been shown to fight …viruses ….\no    Camu Camu’s Vitamin C\nSourced from the Camu Camu plant and pure high dose Vitamin C to build the immune system. Vitamin C is a highly effective antioxidant that protects the body’s cells from pathogens. …Vitamin C deficiency can result in impaired immunity and susceptibility to infections.”\n[from your websites https://www.cfnmedicine.com/covid19-1 and https://www.cancercenterforhealing.com/covid-19-response/]\n\n•    “What am I taking to build my Immune System?  \nCamu Camu's Vitamin C. High dose Vitamin C is an antidote to viruses. It has been used for many years. … #covid2019” [from a March 9, 2020 post on www.facebook.com/ConnealyMD/] \n\n•    “The #Coronavirus is on everyone's mind right now. The key to not catching the virus is to keep your immune system as strong as possible. Perfectly Healthy's Immunity Kit created by Leigh Erin Connealy MD is a potent combination of Vitamin C, Echinacea, Agaricus, and Berberine.” [from a March 11, 2020 post on https://www.facebook.com/CenterForNewMedicine]  \n\n•    “Everyone's been asking Leigh Erin Connealy, M.D., our Medical Director,  about her immune building protocols to protect themselves from the Coronavirus. … Get 15% OFF her Immunity Kit …” \n[from a March 11, 2020 post on https://www.facebook.com/CenterForNewMedicine]  \n\n•    From a video entitled “COVID-19 Prevention: What To Do Now” on your YouTube channel homepage [www.youtube.com/channel/UCwWXwsxn8KGL0UPmJc13IuQ]:\no    “So what am I doing to build my immune system?  First of all, lots and lots of vitamin C. Vitamin C is the antidote for chemicals and viruses … so please  arm yourself with lots of vitamin C. We have the Camu Camu food-based Vitamin C and we have Vitality C.” [from your video entitled “COVID-19 Prevention: What To Do Now” at 0:01-0:24, https://youtu.be/OZlrY5k2NKg] \no    “[T]hen we also have our Power Immune. Now our Power Immune is a unique combination …which is Agaricus blazei, echinachea and berberine. Two immune boosting agents, and berberine is an anti-viral, anti-bacterial substance. You can’t go wrong.” [from your video entitled “COVID-19 Prevention: What To Do Now” at 0:33-0:55, https://youtu.be/OZlrY5k2NKg]\n\nYou should take immediate action to correct the violations cited in this letter. This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products or operations.  It is your responsibility to ensure that the products you sell are in compliance with the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19 related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act. Within 48 hours, please send an email to COVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. Failure to immediately correct the violations cited in this letter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. \n\nFDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list on FDA’s website of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C Act. This list can be found at http://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products. Once you have taken corrective actions to cease the sale of your unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19, and such actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken appropriate corrective action.\n\nIf you cannot complete corrective action within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. \n\nIf you are not located in the United States, please note that products that appear to be misbranded or unapproved new drugs are subject to detention and refusal of admission if they are offered for importation into the United States. We may advise the appropriate regulatory officials in the country from which you operate that FDA considers your product(s) referenced above to be unapproved and misbranded products that cannot be legally sold to consumers in the United States.  \n\nPlease direct any inquiries to FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nIn addition, it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq., to advertise that a product or service can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made.  For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the product identified above.  Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims for the products identified above are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.  Additional examples of claims for products or services that are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence include: \n\n•    “The #Coronavirus pandemic can be dramatically slowed down by boosting our immune systems with Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, Magnesium, Zinc, and other supplements.  It’s crucial to maximize your body’s immune system to prevent and combat viruses.
