We also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/MolluscumAway and https://www.instagram.com/molluscumaway/, where you direct consumers to your website, https://molluscumaway.com/, to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that your website offers “MolluscumAway Hydrating Patches,” “Little Skins Smoothing Skin Ointment,” and “Little Skins Gentle Body Wash” for sale in the United States and that these products are unapproved new drugs under section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a). As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).\n\nMolluscum contagiosum is not a condition amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment, and there are no legally marketed over-the-counter (OTC) drug products to treat this condition. Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection characterized by small, raised lesions on the skin that are known as Mollusca. Molluscum affects both children and adults; however, it is more common in children. In healthy individuals, the lesions usually disappear spontaneously within 6 to 12 months, although in some cases, it could take years to resolve. In sexually active individuals, the lesions found in the genitalia is considered a sexually transmitted disease/infection (STD/STI). In addition, patients with new or existing skin lesions should seek out a healthcare professional to be evaluated. A healthcare professional is needed to rule out the possibility of a more serious condition, such as, skin cancer, fungal infection, and for the genitalia, anogenital warts. Your “MolluscumAway Hydrating Patches,” “Little Skins Smoothing Skin Ointment,” and “Little Skins Gentle Body Wash” products are especially concerning from a public health perspective because they are marketed for use in children. In addition, FDA is concerned that people are forgoing or delaying proper diagnosis and treatment of a potentially serious health condition by purchasing and using an unapproved drug product claiming to treat molluscum contagiosum.\n\nUnapproved New Drugs\n\nBased on a review of your website and social media websites, your “MolluscumAway Hydrating Patches,” “Little Skins Smoothing Skin Ointment,” and “Little Skins Gentle Body Wash” products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nExamples of claims from your website https://molluscumaway.com/ and your social media websites https://www.facebook.com/MolluscumAway and https://www.instagram.com/molluscumaway/ that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\nMolluscumAway Hydrating Patches\n\nOn the product webpage for “MolluscumAway Hydrating Patches,” https://molluscumaway.com/products/copy-of-molluscumaway%E2%84%A2-hydrating-patches-for-skin-care:\n• “MOLLUSCUM AWAY”\n• “MAKE THOSE MOLLUSCUM RUN AWAY”\n• March 2, 2023, customer review by Heathyr K: “If only I had known about and found this product sooner!

This works!”\n\nYour “MolluscumAway Hydrating Patches,” “Little Skins Smoothing Skin Ointment,” and “Little Skins Gentle Body Wash” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for these products. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products.
