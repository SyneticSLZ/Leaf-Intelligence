Suite 112\nClearwater, FL 33762\nUnited States\n\n help@nutrovape.com\n help@nutriair.com\nIssuing Office:\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research | CDER\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\n\nDecember 1, 2021\n\nRE: 617979\n\nDear Mr. Matzkin:\n\nThis is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses www.nutrovape.com and https://nutriair.com/ in October 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for numerous “vaporizer” products, including but not limited to the products named “nutrovape B-Complex,” “nutrovape Diet,” “nutrovape Energy,” “nutrovape Focus,” and “nutrovape Recover” (hereinafter referred to as your “nutrovape vaporizer products”) and “diffuser” products, including but not limited to products named “nutriair Energy,” “nutriair Focus,” “nutriair Immune,” “nutriair Relax,” “nutriair Recover,” and “nutriair Sleep” (hereinafter referred to as your “nutriair diffuser products”)1. We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/nutriair, www.facebook.com/trynutrovape, www.instagram.com/nutri.air, www.instagram.com/nutrovape, www.twitter.com/nutriair, www.twitter.com/nutrovape. These social media websites direct consumers to www.nutrovape.com or https://nutriair.com/, respectively, to purchase your products. The claims on your websites, social media websites, and product packaging, establish that your nutrovape vaporizer products and nutriair diffuser products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n\nFurthermore, the use of your nutrovape vaporizer products and nutriair diffuser products raises safety concerns for the agency because the ingredients and/or impurities in oral inhalation products may trigger laryngospasm or bronchospasm, may be toxic to the tissues in the upper or lower airways, or may be absorbed and exert undesirable systemic effects or organ toxicity.\n\nYou appear to be marketing your nutrovape vaporizer products and nutriair diffuser products as dietary supplements. For example, the labeling for your “Relax” and “Sleep” products in your nutriair and nutrovape product lines include Supplement Facts panels. However, the products’ labeling also states that they are intended for inhalation. The FD&C Act defines the term “dietary supplement” in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i), 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(A)(i), as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Your nutrovape vaporizer products and nutriair diffuser products are not intended for ingestion. Therefore, your products do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under the FD&C Act.\n\nBased on our review of your websites, social media websites, and product packaging, your nutrovape vaporizer products and nutriair diffuser products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/ or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nSome examples of claims observed on your websites and social media websites that established the intended use of your products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\nOn your website, www.nutriair.com:\n\nOn the webpage titled, “Sleep”2:\n\n“Melatonin has been shown to be effective in managing the symptoms of insomnia”\n“Passion Flower Extract: Many pharmacological investigations confirm the sedative effects of Passion Flower, and the short-term subjective sleep benefits. . . additional studies also show anti-anxiety effects.”\n\nOn the webpages titled, “Relax” and “Relax XL”:\n\n“Chamomile Extract: . . . may produce a sedative or relaxant effect by affecting certain brain chemicals, such as serotonin.”\n“Valerian Root Extract: . . . well known for its sedative qualities and its ability to relax the central nervous system and the smooth muscle groups.”\n\nOn the webpages titled, “Recover” and “Recover XL”\n\n“Milk Thistle Extract: Research on Milk Thistle suggests various beneficial effects on the liver.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective. No approved applications are in effect for your products.\n\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to address the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly address these violations may result in enforcement action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps that you have taken to address these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete addressing these violations within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.\n\nYour written reply should be directed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, CDER/OC/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by email to FDAADVISORY@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nCarolyn E.
