Market Street\nKingsport, TN 37660\nUnited States\n\nIssuing Office:\nDivision of Human and Animal Food Operations East V\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\n\nSeptember 10, 2021\n\nDear Mr. Baroody:\n\nThis letter is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the following Internet address: www.holographichealth.com. It was determined that you take orders for your products “Glyco-Well,” “Pan-Gest,” “Heart-Line,” “Aspara-Can,” “Cherry Gold,” “H.H.S.

As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\nExternal Link Disclaimer\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\nGLYCO-WELL\n• “GLYCO-WELL was formulated to regulate blood sugar issues”\n• “Regulates Blood Sugar”\n• “Gymnema Sylestre Extract [an ingredient listed in Glyco-Well] . . .

It stings a little when you first put it in, but stops very soon. This is because you really need it. The more the sting, the more the need.

Some bleed, some protrude, some hurt, and some don’t. But all are problematical [sic]. It appears that what causes their presence is a rather complicated mater. It is not just excessive lifting or constipation. It is involved with many interrelated body systems. Among these are coccyx problems and bowel imbalances. I have also recommended this ointment for excessively rough cracking skin on the feet and hands with excellent results. It can also be used on eternal sores.\n\nUnapproved New Drugs\n\nInformation on your website at www.holographichealth.com indicates that you intend to market your “Pink Lady” product as a dietary supplement. For example, “Pink Lady” is labeled with a Supplement Facts panel; however, it is marketed for topical use. “Pink Lady” does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(A)(i)]. Only products that are intended solely for ingestion may be lawfully marketed as dietary supplements. Topical products and products intended to enter the body through the skin or mucosal tissues are not intended for ingestion. Therefore, your “Pink Lady” is not a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)].\n\nYour “Glyco-Well,” “Pan-Gest,” “Heart-Line,” “Aspara-Can,” “Cherry Gold,” “H.H.S. Formula,” “Brain Balance,” “Passionate Pursuit,” “Better Mood,” “Male Prosexual,” “Ear Well,” “Pink Lady,” “Eye-C,” and “Hemorr-Norm” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. No approved applications are in effect for your products.\n\nMisbranded Drugs\n\nYour “Glyco-Well,” “Pan-Gest,” “Heart-Line,” “Aspara-Can,” “Cherry Gold,” “H.H.S. Formula,” “Brain Balance,” “Passionate Pursuit,” “Better Mood,” “Male Prosexual,” “Ear Well,” and “Pink Lady,” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)], in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for them. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour written reply should be directed to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Allison C. Hunter, Compliance Officer, 6751 Steger Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45237. If you have any questions with regard to this letter, please contact Allison C.
