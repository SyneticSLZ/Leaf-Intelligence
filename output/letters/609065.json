Certain tobacco products, including cigars, pipe tobacco, and cigarettes, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1.\n\nPlease be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the Act. These products include, but are not limited to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including ecigarettes), e-liquids, cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685.\n\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and/or Misbranded\n\nThe FD&C Act generally requires “new tobacco products” to have premarket authorization. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n\nDuring FDA’s January 14-16, 2020 inspection of your manufacturing establishment, FDA determined that you manufacture, sell, and/or distribute to customers in the United States the following new tobacco products after receiving Not Substantially Equivalent (NSE) orders: HOBBY Full Flavor King Box 84mm, HOBBY Gold King Box 84mm, and HOBBY Menthol King Box 84mm.1\n\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act and/or misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. The doing of any act with respect to a tobacco product while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product being adulterated or misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). Additionally, to the extent that a report was required under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act, the failure to provide such report is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)).\n\nTobacco Products Manufactured in an Unregistered Establishment Are Misbranded\n\nDuring FDA’s January 14-16, 2020 inspection, FDA observed that you did not register your manufacturing establishment, located at 8455 Northwest 74th Street, Miami, FL 33166, as required by section 905(c) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(c)). Section 905(c) states that “[e]very person upon first engaging in the manufacture, preparation, compounding, or processing of a tobacco product or tobacco products in any establishment owned or operated in any State by that person shall immediately register with the Secretary that person's name, place of business, and such establishment.” While you submitted initial registration and listing information to FDA in December 2016, FDA informed you by letter on August 6, 2018 that your registration and listing submission could not be processed due to several deficiencies, which you failed to correct.\n\nBecause your establishment was not registered in violation of section 905(c) of the FD&C Act, your tobacco products that were manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed at that establishment are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)). The introduction into interstate commerce of any tobacco product that is misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). In addition, the failure to register your establishment in accordance with section 905 is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)).\n\nTobacco Products Not Listed with FDA Are Misbranded\n\nFDA has determined that no tobacco products manufactured by Heritage Tobacco, LLC are included in a list required by section 905(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(i)). Section 905(i)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(i)(3)(A)) requires that each person who registers with FDA under section 905 biannually report to FDA a list of each tobacco product introduced by the registrant for commercial distribution which has not been included in any list previously filed by that person with the FDA under section 905(i).\n\nBecause no tobacco products manufactured by Heritage Tobacco, LLC are included in a product listing in violation of 905(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(i)), these products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)). The introduction into interstate commerce of any tobacco product that is misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). Additionally, the failure to provide any information required by section 905(i) of the FD&C Act is a prohibited act under section 301(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(p)).\n\nFailure to Pay Assessed User Fees\n\nHeritage Tobacco, LLC is a domestic manufacturer and/or importer of cigars, pipe tobacco, and cigarettes for the purposes of section 919 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387s) and subject to user fees in accordance with that provision. Section 919(b)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387s(b)(6)) requires that each domestic manufacturer and importer of certain tobacco products, including cigars, pipe tobacco, and cigarettes remit payment of its user fee assessment by the last day of the applicable quarter.\n\nFDA has determined that all regulated tobacco products manufactured and/or imported by Heritage Tobacco, LLC are adulterated under section 902(4) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(4)) because you have failed to pay user fees assessed to you as required by section 919 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387s). Specifically, based on our records, you manufacture and/or import tobacco products in the United States, you manufacture products subject to section 919 user fees, and you were assessed user fees by FDA’s Office of Financial Management (OFM) on the dates indicated below. To date, FDA has not received the required payment from you for the assessment invoices enumerated in the table below.\n\n  Fiscal Quarter/Year of Assessment  \t   Assessment Invoice Date  \t   Assessment Due Date   \n1st Quarter 2017\t12/1/2016\t12/31/2016\n2nd Quarter 2017\t3/1/2017\t3/31/2017\n3rd Quarter 2017\t6/1/2017\t7/1/2017\n4th Quarter 2017\t9/1/2017\t10/1/2017\n1st Quarter 2018\t12/1/2017\t12/31/2017\n2nd Quarter 2018\t3/1/2018\t3/31/2018\n3rd Quarter 2018\t6/1/2018\t7/1/2018\n4th Quarter 2018\t9/1/2018\t10/1/2018\n1st Quarter 2019\t12/1/2018\t12/31/2018\n2nd Quarter 2019\t3/1/2019\t3/31/2019\n3rd Quarter 2019\t6/1/2019\t7/1/2019\n4th Quarter 2019\t9/1/2019\t9/30/2019\n1st Quarter 2020\t12/1/2019\t12/31/2019\n2nd Quarter 2020\t3/1/2020\t3/31/2020\n3rd Quarter 2020\t5/31/2020\t6/30/2020\n\nSection 919(b)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387s(b)(6)) requires that payments of all assessments must be made by the last day of the applicable quarter. Because you have failed to pay user fees assessed pursuant to section 919 of the FD&C Act by the last day of the applicable quarter, or by the 30th day after final agency action on a resolution of any dispute as to the amount of fees assessed, regulated tobacco products manufactured and/or imported by Heritage Tobacco, LLC are adulterated under section 902(4) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(4)).\n\nUnder section 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)), the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any tobacco product that is adulterated is a prohibited act.\n\nIn addition, compliance with the requirements of the FD&C Act under section 910(a)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)(2)(A)(i)) includes payment of assessed user fees as set forth in section 919 of the FD&C Act. Accordingly, FDA is unable to issue an order finding a new tobacco product described in a pending or future substantial equivalence (SE) Report -- other than for products marketed between February 15, 2007 and March 22, 2011, and for which an SE report was submitted by March 22, 2011 -- to be substantially equivalent to the predicate tobacco product until a firm has paid its assessed fees in their entirety.\n\nPlease note that entering a repayment plan for assessed user fees does not render a product compliant with the requirements of the FD&C Act. A firm in arrears but on a repayment plan “fails to pay a user fee assessed to such manufacturer or importer pursuant to section 919 by the date specified in section 919 or by the 30th day after final agency action on a resolution of any dispute as to the amount of such fee,” (§902(4) of the FD&C Act) and thus its products are adulterated.\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the ones stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the type described above may result in FDA’s taking regulatory action. These actions may include, but are not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that any adulterated and/or misbranded tobacco products offered for import into the United States are subject to detention and refusal of admission.\n\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your corrective actions, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products, documentation that you have paid or have contacted OFM at userfees@fda.gov for information on how to pay your assessed user fees and how to set up a plan to pay those fees, and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov.\n\nPlease note your reference number, ER2000060, in your response and direct your response to the following address:\n\nDEM-WL Response, Office of Compliance and Enforcement\nFDA Center for Tobacco Products\nc/o Document Control Center\nBuilding 71, Room G335\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nIf you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact Lillian Ortega at (240) 402-9041 or Lillian.Ortega@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nAnn Simoneau, J.D.\nDirector\nOffice of Compliance and Enforcement\nCenter for Tobacco Products\n\n_________________________\n\n1 FDA issued NSE orders to Heritage Tobacco, LLC for these three cigarettes under the Union brand name.
