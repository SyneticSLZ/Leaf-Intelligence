The other problem could be coming from Mercury that has settled in the joints from Dental amalgams or from medications, thus we recommend the Zeolite to clear heavy metals while treating arthritis. Since its discovery, there have been NO ADVERSE REACTIONS in mammals.”\n\nFrom the product catalog on your website, www.bealydecker.com:\n\nOn page 11: “ARTHO FLEX: Cetyl-Myristoleate [an ingredient in Artho Flex] was developed by Harry W.

Seems to aid in reducing inflammation.”\n\nYour products Enzymes Plus, Artho Flex, Herbal Extract, Herbal Compound, Heart / Blood Vessel, Immune, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Lung & Joint Congestion, Liquid Zeolite, Copper, Silver, Magnesium, Zinc, Adult Extra, and CBD Oil Procana Spectrum are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)(1)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d), § 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug based on scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Your products Enzymes Plus, Herbal Extract, Herbal Compound, Heart / Blood Vessel, Immune, Liquid Zeolite, Lung & Joint Congestion and Magnesium are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Enzymes Plus, Herbal Extract, Herbal Compound, Heart / Blood Vessel, Immune, Liquid Zeolite, Lung & Joint Congestion, and Magnesium products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nUnapproved New Animal Drugs\n\nBased on our review of your website www.bealydecker.com, in February 2022, your Equine Calmer, Equine Artho-Flex, Calmer, Herbal Extract, Immune, Lung & Joint Congestion, Liquid Zeolite, and CBD Oil Procana Spectrum products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)], because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal.\n\nExamples of claims observed on your website www.bealydecker.com that establish the intended use of these products as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nEquine Calmer\n\nOn the Equine Calmer product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:\n\n“Useful for all larger animals and birds. ... Helps heal the nervous system and calms them in anxiety situations. Also effective as a natural anti-spasmodic used by horses for shows, gaming, and racing without hampering performance. No adverse side effect observed and generally passes drug testing.”\n\nFrom the Holiday Greetings 2019 newsletter on your website, www.bealydecker.com:\n\n“Some horses have trouble getting so worked up before a barrel race that they can almost not get through the starting gate, but the Equine Calmer is very effective in helping them mentally calm down. I have had some thoroughbred racehorse trainers use this product in the night feeding with young horses first coming to the track for training because it helps calm their fears, relaxing them so they rest better. Sometimes when horses run hard they “tie up” with muscle spasms. The Equine Calmers usually relieves that too.”\n\nEquine Artho-Flex\n\nOn the Equine Artho-Flex product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:\n\n“Helps alleviate most chronic pain; one to three pounds will usually clear arthritis in most animals, especially horses.”\n\nCalmer\n\nOn the Calmer product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:\n\n“Effective, safe product for any kind of stress, anxiety or fear such as travel, new places, training, 4th of July and thunderstorms.”\n\nHerbal Extract\n\nOn the Herbal Extract product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:\n\n“Concentrated liquid herbal blend proven to be VERY effective in fighting viruses: ...

It works effectively in killing the Parvo virus and the Kennel Cough viruses.”\n\nImmune\n\nFrom the Summer Newsletter 2020 on your website, www.bealydecker.com:\n\n“Is your dog suffering from itchy skin and loss of hair? The Immune formula corrects that, brings back a shiny full coat and builds their immune systems in about three months. Also restores low thyroid in animals and people in about the same amount of time.”\n\nLung & Joint Congestion (also referred to as Lung & Joint and Lung & Joint Formula)\n\nOn the Lung & Joint product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:\n\n“The L&J formula will usually stop bleeding in race or performance horses that are called “bleeders”. L & J opens the alveoli because the Lobelia & mullein relax the pressure & lung spasms of bleeders, asthmatics & horses with heaves.”\n\nFrom the Holiday Greetings 2019 newsletter on your website, www.bealydecker.com:\n\n“When we tried the Lung and Joint product on horses suffering from heaves, a form of equine asthma, the response was PHENOMINAL [sic]. We are seeing horses that could not stop coughing and no longer able to work, back out barrel racing and performing, living a full life with their owners. It is only used when they are having difficulties, and takes about 15 minutes to work. So far there has been no adverse side effects, so appears to be safe. We have even seen horses that are “bleeders” when they run, have little or no problems anymore. It is legal to use, even in racehorses.”\n\nLiquid Zeolite\n\nOn the Liquid Zeolite product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:\n\n“Zeolite helps remove heavy metals from the cells of the body by trapping them and other toxins in its honeycomb like framework of cavities and channels, helps balance pH levels, and is 100 percent natural and safe for long term use. ... even animals that are sick, do much better.”\n\nCBD Oil Procana Spectrum\n\nFrom the product catalog on your website, www.bealydecker.com:\n\nOn page 12: “CBD OIL Procana Spectrum ... helps relieve minor and some major pain ... Good for people and animals. ... Seems to aid in reducing inflammation.”\n\nYour Equine Calmer, Equine Artho-Flex, Calmer, Herbal Extract, Immune, Lung & Joint Congestion, Liquid Zeolite, and CBD Oil Procana Spectrum products are “new animal drugs” under section 201(v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(v)] because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, new animal drugs must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or a listing on the Index of Legally Marketed Unapproved New Animal Drugs for Minor Species (“index listing”) under section 512, 571, or 572 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b, § 360ccc, § 360ccc-1], respectively.\n\nYour Equine Calmer, Equine Artho-Flex, Calmer, Herbal Extract, Immune, Lung & Joint Congestion, Liquid Zeolite, and CBD Oil Procana Spectrum products are not the subject of an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b, § 360ccc, § 360ccc-1]. New animal drugs that lack the required approval or index listing are \"unsafe\" and \"adulterated\" under sections 512(a) and 501(a)(5) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a), § 351(a)(5)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of adulterated drugs is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nMisbranded Dietary Supplements\n\nEven if your products Adult Extra, Herbal Compound, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Enzymes Plus, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Lung & Joint Congestion did not have therapeutic claims that make them unapproved new drugs, your dietary supplement products that you distribute under your “Living Free” brand would be misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343]:\n\n1. Your Adult Extra product is misbranded within the meaning of sections 403(a)(1) and 201(n) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1), § 321(n)] in that the label of the product with added iron, fails to bear the required warning statement, as required per 21 CFR 101.17(e).\n\n2. Your Adult Extra, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Enzymes Plus, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size is not declared or is incorrectly declared on the labels. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2.\n\n3. Your Adult Extra, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Enzymes Plus, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(B)] because the labels fail to declare the servings per container in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii).\n\n4. Your Adult Extra, Herbal Compound, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the product labels fail to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example:\n\na. Your Adult Extra, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are manufactured into capsules, but the product labels fail to list the ingredients used to form the capsules.\n\nb. Your Adult Extra product label declares the dietary ingredients P.A.B.A. and Biozyme but these are not the common or usual names for these dietary ingredients.\n\nc. Your Adult Extra, Herbal Compound, Nerve & Muscle, and Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate product labels declare trace mineral complex, but the labels fail to list the components of the complex. Furthermore, your Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, and Immune product labels declare enzyme complex but fail to list the components of the complex.\n\nd. Your Adult Extra product label declares collagen, kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, and thymus. Your Digestion product label declares adrenal and pancreas. Your Nerve & Muscle and Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate product labels declare collagen and thymus. Your Immune product label declares thymus, collagen, liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, and adrenal. Your Heart / Blood Vessel product label declares heart and collagen. Your Liver / Gall Bladder product label declares liver and kidney, and your Lung & Joint Congestion product label declares lung and collagen, but the label fails to identify the source of these ingredients, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(d) and 21 CFR 101.4(g).\n\ne. Your Digestion and Immune product labels declare acidophilus, but this is not the common or usual name for this dietary ingredient. The label must state the complete Latin binomial name.\n\nf. Your Liver / Gall Bladder product label declares stiklewort, but this is not a standardized common name noted in Herbs of Commerce.\n\n5. Your Adult Extra, Immune, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Lung & Joint Congestion, and Heart / Blood Vessel products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] in that the product label fails to correctly declare the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel, as required by 21 CFR 101.7. Specifically:\n\na. Your Adult Extra 500 capsules, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate 500 capsules, and Heart / Blood Vessel 100 capsules product labels fail to present the net quantity of contents statement in letters and numerals in a type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and is not uniform for all packages of substantially the same size, as required under 21 CFR 101.7(i). Specifically, the net contents statement bears the numeral 5 handwritten over the typewritten 1.\n\nb. Your Immune 1 pound and Lung & Joint Congestion product labels declare the net quantity of contents as 1 pound but fail to use the term “net weight”, as required by 21 CFR 101.7(j)(2). Furthermore, these labels fail to express the net quantity of contents in metric units, as required by section 4(a)(2) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act [15 U.S.C. § 1453(a)(2)].\n\n6. Your Adult Extra, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Enzymes Plus, Herbal Compound, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:\n\na. Your product labels fail to present nutrition information in the nutrition label using the title “Supplement Facts” and other format requirements outlined in 21 CFR 101.36(e).\n\nb. Your product labels fail to place the subheading “Serving Size” under the heading “Supplement Facts”, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(i) and fail to place the subheading “Servings Per Container” under the subheading “Serving Size”, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii), except that this information need not be provided when it is stated in the net quantity of contents declaration.\n\nc. Your product labels fail to declare the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and (b)(3)-dietary ingredients in the order and format prescribed in 21 CFR 101.36 which requires the (b)(2)-ingredients to be listed first followed by a heavy bar and then the (b)(3)-dietary ingredients. Furthermore, your Enzymes Plus product label bears the dietary ingredient nattokinase handwritten below the ingredients statement, but nattokinase and its quantitative amount per serving should be located with and presented in the same format as the (b)(3)-dietary ingredients.\n\nd. Your product labels fail to declare the % Daily Values for each (b)(2)-dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii) and fail to state “Daily Value not established” for each (b)(3)-dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(iv). Furthermore, for your Adult Extra product labels, there is no provision for use of the term “RDA” in the Supplement Facts label; it appears that the amounts listed under that term are the quantitative amounts per four capsules. In addition, your Adult Extra product label declares the %DV (as “%US”) for 5 mg of niacin as 100%, but the correct %DV is 25%. Likewise, the product label fails to correctly declare the %DV for manganese, chromium, molybdenum, and selenium.\n\ne. Your Adult Extra and Enzymes Plus product labels fail to express the quantitative amount of each dietary ingredient using a metric measure, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A).\n\nf. Your Adult Extra product label declares “Niacinamide” as a dietary ingredient, but this should be listed as the source of niacin in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d).\n\ng. Your Adult Extra product label declares potassium with an amount of 46 mg per serving which is 1% of the Daily Value. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).\n\nh. Your Heart / Blood Vessel product label fails to declare the sources of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin E and your Lung & Joint Congestion product label fails to declare the sources of vitamin E and vitamin C. The source of each dietary ingredient must be designated on the label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d).\n\n7. Your Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of sections 403(s)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(A)(ii)(I), § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the label fails to include the quantitative amount by weight per serving of each dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3).\n\n8. Your Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(B)] because the label does not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement”, as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).\n\n9. Your Adult Extra, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Herbal Compound, Immune, Liver / Gall Bladder, Heart / Blood Vessel, and Lung & Joint Congestion products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1) and 101.36(d)(1).\n\n10. Your Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Enzymes Plus, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(6) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(6)] because the label makes structure function claims but fails to bear the required dietary supplement disclaimer in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b).\n\n11. Your Heart / Blood Vessel product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(u) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(u)] in that it purports to contain ginseng, but the purported ginseng ingredient is not from a plant classified with the genus Panax. Section 403(u) of the Act, added by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-171), provides that the term \"ginseng\" may only be considered to be a common or usual name (or part thereof) for any herb or herbal ingredient derived from a plant classified within the genus Panax. Specifically, your product contains an ingredient identified as Siberian Ginseng (another common name for Eleutherococcus senticosus as noted in Herbs of Commerce). That ingredient may not be declared under a name that includes the term \"ginseng\" because it is not from the genus Panax.\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nWe also have the following comment: your Digestion and Lung & Joint Congestion product labels misspell cayenne, your Herbal Compound misspells asafetida, your Immune (500 capsules) product label misspells echinacea, your Heart / Blood Vessel product label misspells L-carnitine, your Liver / Gall Bladder product label misspells chicory, and your Lung & Joint Congestion product label misspells lobelia.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.

The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19. Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.",
