We have also reviewed your social media website, https://www.facebook.com/Bodymune/, which directs consumers to your website at https://bodymune.com/ to purchase your product. Additionally, we reviewed your product listings and your seller profile on your Amazon storefront on www.Amazon.com, which you operate under the name “Bodymune Store”. You are also advised that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed your websites in August 2021.\n\nThe claims on your website, social media website, and Amazon storefront establish that your product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that this product is intended for use as a drug include:\n\n• \"DiabetesSupport ‐ Natural Diabetes Support Diabetes Health Pack Optimal Nutrition Diabetes and pre‐Diabetes. . .”\n• “Effective Prediabetes Diabetic Supplement”\n• “SAFE, SYNERGISTIC DIABETES SUPPORT SUPPLEMENT ‐ Our unique blend of Organic Herb Extracts, Organic Fruit Extracts and Organic Essential Oils brings sugar balance to help maintain desired blood sugar level.”\n• “IDEAL FOR ANY DIABETIC SUPPLIES KIT ‐ Carry with you to remember to take regularly, keep your blood sugar levels under control …”\n• “DiabetesSupport helps the body heal itself with reduced dependency, making it the ideal natural diabetes control solution.”\n• “DiabetesSupport is an organic, all natural nutritional support for diabetes and pre‐diabetes.”\n• “Each particular ingredient in DiabetesSupport has been recognized and used over centuries by different cultures for diabetes support.”\n\nOn your Amazon.com storefront product page:\n\n• “Natural Diabetes Support Safe Effective Diabetes Health Pack Diabetes and pre‐Diabetes Supplement. . .”\n• “Our research scientists combined many valuable ingredients in the right proportions to achieve maximum benefit. DiabetesSupport helps the body heal itself with reduced dependency.”\n• “Each particular ingredient in DiabetesSupport has been recognized and used over centuries by different cultures for diabetes support.”\n\nOn your social media Facebook page:\n\n• “DiabetesSupport Natural Diabetes Support” [April 6, 2021]\n\nYour DiabetesSupport product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour product DiabetesSupport is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self‐diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, DiabetesSupport, fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all‐inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address these matters may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nWithin fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address these matters. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.\n\nYour written reply to the above violations should be directed to Rob Genzel Jr. with the FDA via email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. If you have any questions, you may also email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFTC Cease and Desist Demand: In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has determined that it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well‐controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made. POM Wonderful LLC, 155 F.T.C. 1, 60‐61, (2013), aff’d in relevant part, 777 F.3d 478 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Daniel Chapter One, FTC Dkt. No. 9239, 2009 WL 5160000 at *16‐19 (F.T.C. Dec. 24, 2009), aff’d, 405 Fed. Appx.505 (D.C. Cir. 2010); Removatron Int'l Corp., 111 F.T.C. 206, 297‐99 (1988), aff’d, 884 F.2d 1489, 1496 (1st Cir. 1989); see also, FTC v. Direct Mktg. Concepts, 569 F. Supp. 2d 285, 300, 303 (D. Mass. 2008), aff’d, 624 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2010); FTC v. Nat'l Urological Group, Inc., 645 F. Supp. 2d 1167, 1190, 1202 (N.D. Ga. 2008), aff’d, 356 Fed. Appx. 358 (11th Cir. 2009); FTC v. Natural Solution, Inc., No. CV 06‐6112‐JFW, 2007‐2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P75,866, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 60783, at *11‐12 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2007). More generally, to make or exaggerate such claims, whether directly or indirectly, through the use of a product name, website name, metatags, or other means, without rigorous scientific evidence sufficient to substantiate the claims, violates the FTC Act. See Daniel Chapter One, WL 5160000 at *17‐19.\n\nThe FTC is concerned that one or more of the efficacy claims cited above may not be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. Notice is hereby given that you must cease and desist from making any claim that a product and prevent, treat, or cure diabetes without competent and reliable scientific evidence consisting of well‐controlled human clinical studies substantiating that the claims are true. Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction or Administrative Cease and Desist Order. In addition, marketers who make deceptive claims about the treatment, cure, prevention, or mitigation of a disease may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $43,792 per violation pursuant to Section 5(m)(1)(B) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(m)(1)(B), and may be required to pay refunds to consumers or provide other relief pursuant to Section 19(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 57b(b). With regard to the advertising claims discussed above, please notify Richard Cleland of the FTC via electronic mail at rcleland@ftc.gov within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter of the specific actions you have taken to address FTC's concerns.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\nGlenn Bass\nActing\nDeputy Director\nOffice of Compliance\nCenter for Food Safety\n    and Applied Nutrition\nFood and Drug Administration\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\nSerena Viswanathan\nAssociate Director\nDivision of Advertising Practices\nFederal Trade Commission",
