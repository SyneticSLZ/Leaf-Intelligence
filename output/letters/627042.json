Laroche\n                                                                 GreenWay Herbal Products, LLC (d/b/a Tanasi)\n                                                                 509 W. College Street\n                                                                 Murfreesboro, TN 37130\n\nRE:         Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n\nThis is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://tanasi.com/ on February 18, 2022, and March 22, 2022, respectively.  We also reviewed your social media website at https://www.facebook.com/tanasibotanicals/, where you direct consumers to your website, https://tanasi.com/, to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that your website offers cannabidiol (CBD) products for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191  in people.  Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).\n\nThere is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.2  In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.3  Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.\n\nSome examples of the claims on your website and social media website that establish the intended use of your products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include: \n\n•    “Does CBD Defend Against COVID? . . .\n\nAt the University Of Chicago, a team led by Marsha Rosner discovered that CBD curbs COVID-19 cell infections in lab experiments. By using small doses of CBD (approximately what patients would receive in an oral drug), the team discovered that CBD didn’t stop the spread of COVID-19 in test tubes. Rather, it started acting as soon as the virus entered healthy cells, blocking it from making copies of itself, thanks to interferon (an inflammatory protein).\n\nCBD, COVID and Epilepsy\n\nWhen the team studied adults with severe epilepsy, they realized that individuals on Epidiolex, a CBD-based medication, showed lower COVID-19 infection rates. . . . Another team from Oregon State University, led by Richard van Breeman, recently shared a report in the Journal of Natural Products. It stated that high doses of CBDA and CBG actually prevent coronavirus from breaking into cells.” [from the January 30, 2022 blog post on your webpage https://tanasi.com/blog/does-cbd-defend-against-covid/] \n\n•    “3 CBDA Studies To Know Right Now . . .\n\n3. COVID\n\nA lab study in the Journal of Nature Products shows that cannabis compounds inhibit the COVID 19 virus from easily penetrating healthy human cells. Specifically, CBDA, and CBGA possess the ability to combat coronavirus. . . . \n\nEven better? Researchers examined the compounds’ impact against the COVID’s alpha and beta variants in a laboratory. And they proved effective. . . . lead researcher Richard van Breemen said that these compounds could prevent and even treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. And he suggested taking them orally, thanks to their extended history of safe application in humans. . . .\n\nYou can enjoy the better-together benefits of CBDa and CBD in Tanasi’s range of full-spectrum hemp extracts.” [from the January 27, 2022 blog post on your webpage https://tanasi.com/blog/3-cbda-studies-to-know-right-now/]\n\n•    “Cannabis and Covid: New Hope For Preventing Infections and Speeding Recovery . . .\n\nCannabis and COVID: Preventing Infection\n\nIn the new study, author Richard van Breemen reveals that cannabinoids can help prevent a Sars-Cov-2 infection., [sic] How does that work? It seems that they block Covid-19 from entering your healthy cells. And, while all cannabinoids may be useful, two offer the most protection:  CBGA and CBDA.  (Also known as cannabigerolic acid and cannabidiolic acid.)\n\nNow, if you’re familiar with our Tanasi products, you probably know that these two compounds have many potential therapeutic properties. But now, with this study, we’ve learned that they may fight COVID by binding to the virus’ spike proteins. In turn, this makes it harder for Covid to force its way into your body’s healthy cells, possibly preventing infection.\n\nAlready, that’s pretty exciting news. And it keeps getting better, because the cannabinoids seem to work against several Covid variants.” . . .\n\nCannabis and COVID: How Cannabinoids Fuel Recovery from Infection\n\nAfter announcing his new findings, van Breemen also said that cannabinoids ‘have the potential to prevent as well as treat infection by SARS-CoV-2.’” [from the January 14, 2022 blog post on your webpage https://tanasi.com/blog/cannabis-and-covid-how-cannabinoids-could-prevent-infection/] \n\n•    “The Latest Information On CBD Covid Implications\n\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak affects countries across the globe, we’re all hoping and waiting for new disease treatments. Thankfully, the latest studies and research shows cannabis’ potential to treat coronavirus-related symptoms. . . .\n\n2. CBD May Prevent a Cytokine Storm, and stop the Havoc it Wreaks in the Body\n\nEarly results of an ongoing study published in HealthEuropa suggest that a specific combination of cannabinoids and terpenes appears to be twice as effective as the corticosteroid dexamethasone at lowering COVID-19 inflammation. . . .\n\n3. Ongoing Research Is Examining The Full Effects Of The Virus And How CBD Can Mitigate Long-Term Damage\n\nResearch from the Rabin Medical Center holds another clue. Their findings suggest that 8 out of the 11 patients receiving cannabis treatments program saw improvements in virus-related infections.\n\nCBD Covid Treatment: Can Cannabis Help?\n\nMany researchers believe that CBD might help fight COVID-19. It’s classified as a contagious respiratory illness that causes fatigue, breathing problems, and fever. For some people, it’s proven to be fatal. So could CBD and cannabis offer assistance in the ongoing fight against Covid-19? . . .\n\nCBD shows significant potential in the fight against Covid-19, mainly due to its significant anti-inflammatory properties. The latest research shows that cannabis and CBD might drastically improve Covid-19 symptoms. It could do so by lowering cytokine storms and protecting lung tissue from inflammation.” [from the October 3, 2021 blog post on your webpage https://tanasi.com/blog/cbd-covid-treatment-option/]\n\n•    “5 Things You Need to Know About THCV . . .\n\nAnti-Inflammatory Effects . . .\n\nMore recently, THCV was highlighted in connection with cannabinoids’ anti-inflammatory impact on Covid-19- lung inflammation. The research, published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports, suggests that cannabigerol (CBG) and low-dose THCV reduces inflammation in Covid patients’ lung cells. But at this time, there are no approved cannabinoid COVID treatments. . . .\n\n3. Most cannabis plants produce low concentrations of THCV. Certain strains can offer higher concentrations. . . . your best bet may be from the entourage effect associated with our full-spectrum CBD products.” [from the June 4, 2021 blog post on your webpage https://tanasi.com/blog/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-thcv/]\n\n•    “The Effects of Hemp on Inflammation . . . \n\nThe Medical College of Georgia and Dental College of Georgia recently conducted a relevant study. It showed that CBD could help reduce cytokine storms . . . and unrestricted lung inflammation in patients with Covid-19.” [from the November 17, 2020 blog post on your webpage https://tanasi.com/blog/effects-of-hemp-on-inflammation/]\n\n•    “What Is Dexamethasone? \n\nDexamethasone has recently emerged as the best drug to treat severe life-threatening cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). . . . Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid that is used as an anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant agent. . . .  \n\nWhat Are the Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Cannabinoids? . . . \n\nGreenWay Tanasi, LLC, and its brand, Tanasi, a subsidiary of GreenWay Herbal Products, LLC, sells a number of cannabidiol (CBD) products that feature a unique patent-pending blend of cannabinoids (CBD and Cannabidiolic-acid (CBDA)) extracted from Cannabis Sativa L. hemp plants.  GreenWay Herbal Products, LLC developed this patent-pending technology with a university partner, which has demonstrated that cannabinoids are natural anti-inflammatory agents that can suppress cytokine storms.  In direct comparison studies, the unique formulation of cannabinoids used in the Tanasi CBD product line was as effective as dexamethasone in reducing cytokine storms.  Thus [sic] it is not surprising that customers using the Tanasi CBD/CBDA products report that they are very effective at reducing a number of inflammatory conditions.  See the customer reviews at www.tanasi.com. Tanasi is not recommending using its CBD/CBDA patent-pending formula as a treatment for COVID-19.” [from the July 2, 2020 blog post on your webpage https://tanasi.com/blog/what-is-dexamethasone/]\n\n•    “In the new study, author Richard van Breemen reveals that cannabinoids can help prevent a Sars-Cov-2 infection.\n\nIt seems that they block Covid-19 from entering your healthy cells.
