We also reviewed your social media website at www.facebook.com/AmbayaGoldHealth, which directs consumers to your website at www.ambayagold.com to purchase your products. The claims on your websites establish these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B)/(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. §§ 321(g)(1)(B)/(C)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act.

MSM May Treat Arthritis and Joint Pain…Arthritis is probably the most known condition that MSM is used for, especially osteoarthritis. …MSM might lessen the pain associated with it. One study of 100 people…found that treatment with a supplement containing MSM for 12 weeks lessened pain, stiffness and swelling in the joints, compared to a placebo.”\n    − “4. MSM May Help with Digestive Problems…may improve symptoms in patients with Leaky Gut Syndrome…One study, however, did show oral intake of MSM assisted in protecting gut damage in rats with colitis. MSM supplements may also reduce swelling and discomfort caused by hemorrhoids.”\n    − “8. MSM May Relieve Allergies…MSM can decrease allergic reactions by lowering inflammation and inhibiting the release of cytokines and prostaglandins thanks to its anti-inflammatory. …It was found that allergy symptoms and lower respiratory symptoms were reduced in people with seasonal allergic rhinitis after taking MSM supplementation for one month.”\n    − “9. MSM May Help With Parasites…may be an effective treatment for worms, giardia and trichomonas. …MSM coats the gut lining making it impossible for parasites to attach themselves. They are then naturally flushed out of the body. Candida is when the body experiences an overgrowth in fungus which can cause various health problems. MSM changes the PH in your body where Candida can not [sic] thrive in.”\n\nEssensiac product\n\nOn the Essensiac product webpage (https://ambayagold.com/products/essensiac):\n\n• On the image of your product label:\n    − “[E]ssiac tea…for…reducing inflammation”\n• “Slippery Elm Bark [an ingredient in Essensiac]… can provide anti-inflammatory support.”\n\nOn the “Honoring the Benefits of Slippery Elm Tree” blog post, dated November 7, 2022, (https://ambayagold.com/blogs/news/honoring-the-benefits-of-slippery-elm-tree), which contains a hyperlink to purchase Essensiac:\n\n• “[H]ealth benefits of slippery elm bark [an ingredient in Essensiac] come from the biochemical compounds that are extracted from it.

Disinfects like hydrogen peroxide without the burn . . .” [https://www.instagram.com/p/CmSADzUva93/ and https://www.facebook.com/AmbayaGoldHealth/posts/pfbid02Hkd21pHbyrU5TL1MaAgRh1E9CJWtbKVenM5kyQaRtKtC4G9XL2ZMZZ58u7LApMGQl]\n\nMagnesium Oil Spray product\n\n“Our fast acting topical Magnesium Oil Spray offers the benefits of pure Magnesium Oil in a proprietary Fulvic base. . . .This convenient spray is designed is designed to provide relief from body tension and soreness quickly and effectively. . . .For muscle cramps or pains, spray directly on problem area.” [from your product website, https://ambayagold.com/products/magnesium-oil-spray]\n\nSpecifically, these products are intended for use as a first aid antiseptic, and an external analgesic, respectively1\n\nUnapproved New Drugs\n\nYour Brain Balance, Immune System Boost, Dentist In A Bottle, Essensiac, Fulvic Green, Silver Solution, and Detox Cleanse Renew products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nFurther, your “Silver Spray” product, containing silver, is a first aid antiseptic subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, which governs nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application. Specifically, your silver-containing product falls under section 505G(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, because FDA has determined that no silver containing OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective under a final determination issued under 21 CFR part 330.2, 3  Therefore, Silver Spray is a “new drug” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act is in effect for this drug product. Accordingly, “Silver Spray” is an unapproved new drug marketed in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d).\n\nYour “Magnesium Oil Spray” is a topical external analgesic drug subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, which governs nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application. Under section 505G of the of the FD&C Act, certain nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application —commonly referred to as \"OTC monograph drugs\"—may be legally marketed if they meet applicable requirements. With respect to OTC external analgesic drug products, such products are deemed to be GRASE and not new drugs if, among other things, they conform to the conditions of use set forth in the final administrative order, Over-the-Counter Monograph M017: External Analgesic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (“M017”).4\n\nHowever, “Magnesium Oil Spray” does not conform to the conditions specified in the final administrative order for the reasons described below. Your “Magnesium Oil Spray” is not formulated and labeled as an external analgesic counterirritant drug product that is consistent with the final administrative order. Specifically, your product is labeled to contain the ingredients magnesium chloride, fulvic, indium, aloe vera, pyridoxine HCl (B6), MSM, and plant based phytonutrients, all of which are outside of the final applicable administrative order. According to 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2), an “active ingredient” means any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of humans. Although your firm does not specifically list these ingredients as active ingredients, your product website includes statements that claim this combination of ingredients is “designed to provide relief from body tension and soreness” as a treatment for symptoms related to magnesium deficiency that include “leg cramps and muscle soreness,” along with “migraines, insomnia, [and] fatigue.” Such statements demonstrate that those ingredients are considered “active ingredients” as defined by 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2) because this combination of ingredients is intended to furnish pharmacological activity. However, this combination of active ingredients is not permitted under the applicable final order nor are any of these ingredients permitted as a single active ingredient in an external analgesic product under the final administrative order.\n\nThus, as formulated and labeled, “Magnesium Oil Spray” does not comply with the final administrative order described above or any applicable proposed or final rule. FDA is not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in the published literature that support a determination that “Magnesium Oil Spray” is GRASE for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in its labeling. Moreover, there is no evident basis under the FD&C Act under which this product would be legally marketed without an approved application. Therefore, “Magnesium Oil Spray” is a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). Accordingly, “Magnesium Oil Spray” is an unapproved new drug marketed in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d).\n\nIn addition, “Silver Spray” and “Magnesium Oil Spray” are misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee) because they are nonprescription drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, are not the subject of applications approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, and do not comply with the requirements under section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h. Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).\n\nMisbranded Drugs\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour Brain Balance, Silver Solution, Dentist In A Bottle, Essensiac, Fulvic Green, and Detox Cleanse Renew products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, the Brain Balance, Silver Solution, Dentist In A Bottle, Essensiac, Fulvic Green, and Detox Cleanse Renew products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nUnapproved New Animal Drugs\n\nBased on our review of your website www.ambayagold.com and your social media website www.facebook.com/AmbayaGoldHealth, your Pet Health+ product is a drug under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal.\n\nExamples of claims observed on your website and social media website that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include:\n\nPet Health+ product\n\nOn the Pet Health+ product webpage (https://ambayagold.com/products/pet-health):\n\n• “Detox of heavy metals, chemicals and other toxins* Protection from worms, parasites, and fungus* Natural anti-inflammatory agents*…Protection from infection*…Accelerated wound recovery*”\n• “In our Pet Health +, our clean sourced Clinoptilolite Zeolite is formulated and suspended in a freshwater Humic and Fulvic liquid solution. The Humic helps to penetrate deep into the cells, providing a cleansing action by safely binding harmful toxins.”\n• “Why Silver and Gold? Monatomic Silver is considered a powerful natural antibacterial element because its ions cause inhibition of bacterial growth. Silver ions' interaction with enzymes and proteins play an important and essential role in antibacterial efficacy in the body.”\n• A customer testimonial from 2/18/2022 states, “This product has help [sic] to support for our new dog’s… anxiety issues…”\n\nOn the “Natural Remedies for Pain Relief in Dogs” blog post, dated December 5, 2022, (https://ambayagold.com/blogs/news/natural-remedies-for-pain-relief-in-dogs), which contains a hyperlink to purchase Pet Health+:\n\n• “Holistic pet supplements and pain relievers can have a wide range of benefits like: …Assistance with detox of heavy metals, chemicals, and other toxins…Protection from worms, parasites, fungus, and infection…Natural anti-inflammatory agents…Accelerated wound recovery…All of the above benefits have been reported by users of our pet multivitamin, Pet Health+ [hyperlinks to the Pet Health+ product page].\n\nOn your Facebook account (https://www.facebook.com/AmbayaGoldHealth/) post, dated May 15, 2022:\n\n• “Pet Health+ helps…Assist with detox of heavy metals, chemicals, and other toxins…Protect from worms, parasites, fungus, and infection”\n\nOn your Facebook account (https://www.facebook.com/AmbayaGoldHealth/) post, dated October 8, 2021, with three photos of a cat:\n\n• “…[H]er cat’s obsessive grooming…This caused her to form “hot spots” where the skin had become inflamed and formed open wounds. …When modern medicine didn’t help, she tried Pet Health+ and here are her results after ONLY a week and a half!”\n\nYour Pet Health+ product is a \"new animal drug\" under section 201(v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(v)] because it is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. Pet Health+ is not approved, conditionally approved, or index listed by the FDA, and therefore this product is considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)] and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)].

Your firm lists these two products on your website under the heading “Supplements.” Under section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(2)(A)(i)], a dietary supplement is defined, among other things, as a product intended for ingestion. Topical products and other products that are not intended for ingestion cannot be dietary supplements.\n\n2 See 21 CFR 310.548(b): \"Any OTC drug product containing colloidal silver ingredients or silver salts that is labeled, represented, or promoted for the treatment and/or prevention of any disease is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) for which an approved application or abbreviated application under section 505 of the Act and part 314 of this chapter is required for marketing. In the absence of an approved new drug application or abbreviated new drug application, such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the Act.”\n\n3 FDA’s final determination was codified in regulations at 21 CFR 310.545(a)(8)(i). Under section 505G(k)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, the non-monograph conditions in 21 CFR 310.545 in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the CARES Act (i.e., March 26, 2020) are deemed to be a final administrative order. The final administrative order is entitled “Non-Monograph Conditions NM900: Drug Products Containing Certain Active Ingredients Offered Over-the-Counter for Certain Uses” (See Order ID OTC000007, available at OTC Monographs@FDA, https://dps.fda.gov/omuf).\n\n4 Section 505G(a)(1) of the FD&C Act specifies criteria under which certain nonprescription drugs without an approved application are deemed GRASE and not \"new drugs,\" notably, conformance with conditions detailed in applicable OTC monograph documents issued by FDA under 21 CFR. part 330 prior to enactment of the CARES Act. In the case of OTC anorectal drug products, relevant documents were deemed under section 505G to be a final administrative order, Over-the-Counter Monograph M017: External Analgesic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (See Order ID OTC000033, available at FDA’s website OTC Monographs@FDA, https://dps.fda.gov/omuf).",
