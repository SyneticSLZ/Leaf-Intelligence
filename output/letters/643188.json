Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nThis inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\n\nWe received responses from Scafford Serron, Ph.D., VP of Global Quality dated June 16, 2022, July 18, 2022, and August 18, 2022, concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, which was issued to your firm. We address this response below, in relation to each of the noted violations.\n\nThese violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to verify a process that cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test with a high degree of assurance and approved according to established procedures. The validation activities and results, including the date and signature of the individual(s) approving the validation and where appropriate the major equipment validated, shall be documented, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(a) – Process Validation. For example:\n\na. The catheter wash limitation process justifications (b)(4) dated October 31,2018 and (b)(4) dated June 10, 2021, do not specify the requirements for the catheter wash process validation prior to conducting the process validation. Additionally, the justifications provided for several test parameters do not provide a high degree of assurance and were not approved according to established procedures. Prior to the 2018 validation, this process had not been validated according to established procedures. Therefore, it is unknown if the catheter wash process sufficiently removes foreign material from the manufacturing process.\n\nThe responses dated June 16, 2022, July 18, 2022, and August 18, 2022 are not adequate. Your firm initiated CAPA(b)(4) to address Observation 1 and identified four root causes and training corrective actions, and conducted a retrospective review of processes requiring validation. Documents gathered at the inspection, “(b)(4)” (b)(4) and (b)(4), and provided in the response, “(b)(4)” (b)(4) require biocompatibility testing comply with ISO 10993-1. However, CAPA(b)(4) does not provide a high degree of assurance, as addressed in the FDA-recognized standard ISO-10993 [Biocompatibility]. For example:\n\ni)  Per Part 1 of ISO-10993, a gap analysis and selection of biological endpoints for assessment is necessary to assess the biological safety of the medical device. The proposed responses and corrective actions do not address all biological endpoints, including pyrogenicity.\n\nii)  Per Part 5 of ISO-10993, cytotoxicity testing standards require that the cytotoxicity be addressed at 24 hours and 48 hours, and that the results after 48 hours be less than or equal to Grade 2 by quantitative methods. The proposed responses and corrective actions incorrectly state the acceptance criteria to be, “Non cytotoxicity response with a test score of ≤2 at 24-Hour observation.”\n\niii)  The validation process and corrective actions fail to address the residual sterilant levels after the changed catheter wash procedure and device sterilization. Per ISO 10993-7, “A valid method of extraction and measurement shall be used to determine the amount of EO and, where necessary, ECH delivered to the patient.”\n\niv)  The proposed corrective actions do not address design transfer for the software validation functionality testing, in which there is failure to ensure that the device design is correctly translated into production specifications, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(h).\n\nb. It cannot be verified from the non-equipment software test report: coating tracker software (b)(4) that the tasks requiring a specific number of repeats for validation were conducted for the required number of repeats per the protocol.\n\nThe responses dated June 16, 2022, July 18, 2022, and August 18, 2022 indicate that the root cause investigation is completed, additional review of all other previously completed non-equipment software production pertaining to the hydrophilic coating process were identified and are being implemented, and corrective actions are ongoing under CAPA(b)(4). The adequacy of the responses cannot be determined until the outstanding inadequacies with CAPA(b)(4) under Observation 01 are addressed.\n\n2.  Failure to establish and maintain adequate procedures for implementing and maintaining corrective and preventive actions, as required by 21 CFR 820.100. For example:\n\na. Your firm’s Supplier Corrective Action Request (SCAR) Process (b)(4) requires that the firm open a SCAR “when it is determined that a supplier corrective action is need for an NCR” (Nonconformance Report). The FDA investigator collected examples of nonconformance reported quality problems where no SCAR was opened by your firm as required by its procedure. Additionally, because these corrective actions were taken as a result of these nonconformances outside of your firm’s corrective action procedures, no evaluation as to whether actions taken adversely affected the finished device was completed, nor were the corrections verified as effective, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(4).\n\nThe responses dated June 16, 2022, July 18, 2022, and August 18, 2022 are not adequate. Your firm initiated CAPA(b)(4) to address Observation 5 and identified five root causes. Your firm updated its procedure, (b)(4) to provide clarification to its employees as to when a SCAR needs to be initiated. Your firm submitted documentation that supports training of its employees on the new procedure. Your firm states that it will ensure each corrective and preventive action is effective through the Verification of Effectiveness process, though it is not clear exactly how and when that will occur. Your firm initiated a 3-year retrospective review of supplier NCR events where SCARs were not initiated and plans to evaluate any adverse effects of these NCRs as part of the CAPA underway. This activity is scheduled to be completed at the end of October 2022. The adequacy of your firm’s responses will be evaluated after you submit clarification of your plan to ensure effectiveness of the implemented corrective actions and documentation to support that effectiveness when complete.\n\nb. Your firm’s CAPA system fails to identify “rejects” as nonconforming product and therefore misses all nonconforming product during the manufacturing process as a quality data input for the CAPA system, as required by 21 CFR820.100(a)(1). Without nonconforming product as a quality data input to the CAPA system, the ability to detect recurring quality problems is greatly diminished.\n\nThe responses dated June 16, 2022, July 18, 2022, and August 18, 2022 are not adequate. Your firm stated that its Quality Reporting procedure does require your firm to periodically review rejected material and that its employees “could” request a CAPA if they decided to based on that review. Your firm updated its CAPA procedure (b)(4) to include Reject data/trend for consistent wording between its other relevant SOPs for Quality Reporting to be more clear that rejected material needs to be investigated as nonconforming product and that data needs to be fed into the CAPA system. Your firm stated that it has “made employees aware” and that effectiveness checks are planned to be completed by February 2023. It is not clear whether your firm has evaluated whether the periodic reviews of the rejected material historically have warranted an investigation. Information is needed to clarify whether a retrospective review has been completed or is planned.\n\n3.  Failure to adequately establish and maintain procedures to control product that does not conform to specified requirements. The procedures shall address the identification, documentation, evaluation, segregation, and disposition of nonconforming product. The evaluation of nonconformance shall include a determination of the need for an investigation and notification of the persons or organizations responsible for the nonconformance. The evaluation and any investigation shall be documented, as required by 21 CFR 820.90(a). For example:\n\nDuring production and quality inspection, nonconforming product is identified as a “reject”. While rejected/nonconforming product is identified, documented, and segregated, the firm is not evaluating the nonconformance to determine the need for an investigation and notification of persons or organizations responsible for the nonconformance, as required by 21 CFR 820.90(a).\n\nThe responses dated June 16, 2022, July 18, 2022, and August 18, 2022 are not adequate. Your firm made initial corrections to several procedures and definitions to ensure that rejected nonconforming product during the manufacturing process is accurately captured, trended, and fed into its CAPA system. Part of the issue related to a high reject rate was due to material that was destroyed during testing being labeled as “reject” in addition to actual nonconforming product. Your firm implemented an IT solution to label those samples separately as “destroyed” instead of “reject”. Your firm states that it has notified its relevant employees of the definition and procedure change. Your firm states that it plans to conduct effectiveness checks for CAPA (b)(4) and included the planned evaluation and timeframe for doing so, with a completion date of February 2023. Your firm also mentions a “preventive” action that plans to look at other product lines and systems where “reject” is used as a product designation to ensure that they are not missing any other nonconforming product documentation. It is not clear whether this includes a retrospective review of previous rejected materials in an attempt to determine whether an investigation needs to be opened into those nonconforming product. The adequacy of your firm’s responses will be evaluated after you provide information clarifying whether a retrospective review of rejected product will occur to determine whether an investigation can or should be done at this time.\n\nOther federal agencies may take your compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations into account when considering the award of federal contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been addressed.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing, within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter, of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm's planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Please provide a translation of documentation not in English to facilitate our review. We will notify you regarding the adequacy of your firm’s response and the need to re-inspect your firm’s facility to verify that the appropriate corrections and/or corrective actions have been made. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration as part of your response.\n\nYour firm's response should be sent to CDRHWarningLetterResponses@fda.hhs.gov, or if e-mail cannot be used:\n\nFood and Drug Administration - CDRH/ORP/DRP2\nCDRH Regulatory Inspections and Audit Team, WO66-1434\n10903 New Hampshire Ave.\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\n\nRefer to CMS case # 472344 when replying.\n\nIf you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Lydia Glaw, PhD at lydia.glaw@fda.hhs.gov or 301-796-1456.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm's facility. It is your firm's responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm's manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n/S/\n\nBram Zuckerman, M.D.\nDirector\nOffice of Cardiovascular Devices\nOffice of Product Evaluation and Quality\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nCC:\nAmy Smith\n35 Enterprise, Aliso Viejo, CA US 92656",
