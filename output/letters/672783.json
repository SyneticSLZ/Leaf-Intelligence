This request went unanswered, as did the second and third email requests sent on June 6 and 21, 2023, respectively. An FDA representative then attempted to contact your U.S. Agent on August 25, 2023. A fourth email attempt to contact you was sent on August 29, 2023, but you failed to respond. The Agency then sent a follow-up written request via UPS, that was delivered to the physical address provided in your registration file on August 29, 2023. Delivery to you was confirmed by the shipper, but you failed to respond.\n\nUnder section 501(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(j), your drugs are adulterated in that they have been manufactured, processed, packed, or held in an establishment that delays, denies, or limits an inspection, or refuses to permit entry or inspection.\n\nSee FDAâ€™s guidance document, Circumstances that Constitute Delaying, Denying, Limiting, or Refusing a Drug Inspection, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm360484.pdf.\n\nFDA placed your firm on Import Alert 55-03 on January 18, 2024.\n\nUntil FDA is permitted to inspect your facility and confirms compliance with CGMP, we may withhold approval of any new applications or supplements listing your firm as a drug manufacturer. In addition, shipments of articles manufactured at Mei Lan (Thailand) Co., Ltd., at 35/252-253 Moo 2, Tambol Bangnamched, Muang District, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samutsakorn, Thailand into the United States that appear to be adulterated or misbranded are subject to being detained or refused admission pursuant to section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3).\n\nAfter you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working days. In response to this letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as we continue to assess your activities and practices, and/or submit a request to schedule an FDA inspection.\n\nSend your electronic reply to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov. Identify your response with FEI 3012190301 and ATTN: Rokhsana Jazi.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nFrancis Godwin\nDirector\nOffice of Manufacturing Quality\nOffice of Compliance\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research",
