Nguyen\nManager/Owner\nRobbins Instruments, LLC\n\n2003 Edwards Street\nHouston, TX 77007\nUnited States\n\n (b)(6)@robbinsinstruments.com\nIssuing Office:\n\"ORP: Office of Regulatory Programs, Office of Product Evaluation and Quality\"\n\nUnited States\n\n\n\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\nCMS #687984\n\nJanuary 21, 2025\n\nDear Mr. Nguyen:\n\nDuring an inspection of your firm located at 2003 Edwards Street, Houston, TX 77007, FEI 2221941, on March 27 through May 31, 2024, an investigator from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your firm is a manufacturer and distributor of the Dermo-Jet Needleless Injector.  Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), this product is a device because it is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nUnapproved Device Violation\n\nFDA has learned that your firm is marketing the Dermo-Jet Needleless Injector without marketing clearance or approval, in violation of the Act. FDA has determined, based on information provided by your firm that the Dermo-Jet Needleless Injector is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). The device is also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the device into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k).\n\nSpecifically, the instructions for use document for the Dermo-Jet Needleless Injector included in the company’s SOP document provided during the referenced inspection outlines the following indications: “The DERMO-JET is a versatile, time-tested, medical instrument for administration of sub-topical injections of parenteral medicaments, anesthetic solutions, steroids in aqueous suspension, soluble drugs, vaccines, antibiotics, etc.”  \n\nIn addition, the Robbins Instruments brochure for the DERMO-JET collected during the referenced inspection, includes many specific claims, as provided below:\n\n•    “Painless Uses – A local Anesthetic prior to an injection using a syringe with a needle or a puncture (lumbar, pleural, articular, sternal, etc).\n•    Intradermic Injections and Tests – The reading of the result of the test is clear due to the absence of any secondary infection which might be caused by a needle.\n•    Intradermic Vaccinations – BCG, Anti-cholera, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Measles.\n•    Mesotherapy – Needleless injection can be given for intradermic treatment, local anesthetics or in connection with reflexology.\n•    Dermatology – This method can be used for in situ injections in the treatment of alopecia, psoriasis, keloids and hypertrophic scars, sclerosis, keratosis, acne, etc.\n•    Phlebology – Anesthetics prior to a thrombectomy and before hardening injections.\n•    Urology – The treatment of Peyronie’s disease.\n•    Proctology – The treatment of hemorrhoids.\n•    Gynecology – Needleless injections of progesterone to regularize the ovarian cycles.\n•    Minor Surgery – Painless suturing. By making contiguous papules one produces linear zones of anesthetic which help incision with a bistouri.\n•    Miscellaneous Uses – Acupuncture, sports medicine, aesthetic medicine, etc.”\n\nFor a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. [21 CFR 807.81(b)] The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the device is described on the Internet at \nhttp://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed.\n\nFDA requests that Robbins Instruments, LLC cease any activities that result in the misbranding or adulteration of the Dermo-Jet Needleless Injector, such as the commercial distribution of the devices for the uses discussed above., including selling to initial importers, distributors, or other third parties for distribution and use within the United States or otherwise representing these devices to have the requisite clearance or authorization for marketing in the United States.\n\nQuality System Regulation Violations\n\nOur inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\n\nWe received responses from Danny Nguyen, Manager/Owner on June 21, 2024, July 18, 2024, and August 15, 2024, concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, that was issued to your firm. We address these responses below, in relation to each of the noted violations.  These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1.    Failure to review, evaluate and document the process and perform revalidation when changes or process deviations occurs, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(c).\n\nSpecifically, your firm did not revalidate the changes made to your Dermo-Jet Needleless Injector Moist Heat Sterilization Method. You changed the sterilization process parameters from 134°C for 18 minutes to 121°C/250°F for 30 minutes or 132°C/270°F for 4 minutes as identified in your product labeling IFU which you provide as cleaning and sterilization instructions to your customers. On August 23, 2019, your OEM Manufacturer validated the moist heat sterilization method under Study No. 1907-421 at 134°C for 18 minutes but you altered the temperature and time limits without conducting revalidation of your new sterilization parameters. You have distributed approximately 400 Dermo-Jet Needleless Injectors to your customers with the updated cleaning and sterilization instructions. In addition, you have not established a process validation procedure required under 21 CFR Part 820.75(b).  \n\nWe reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm submitted the sterilization validation report (High-power Study No. 1907-421) and a document change request form (DCR-01) dated 6/27/24 aimed at updating your moist heat sterilization specification to conform with the original sterilization parameters established by AKRA. It appears your firm has reverted to the moist heat sterilization parameters validated under study 1907-421, however, you have not addressed “Drying Time at minimum of 10 minutes” added to your Dermo-Jet Cleaning and Sterilization Sheet. In response to this letter, please provide updates and supporting documentation of your corrective actions as they are implemented.\n\n2.    Failure to adequately establish design change procedures, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(i).\n\nSpecifically, your firm has not established a design change procedure.  Your firm updated the sterilization instruction in your instruction for use (IFU) without identification, documentation, validation or where appropriate verification, review and approval of design changes before their implementation.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm provided Biological Risk Assessment for the Dermo-jet HR (DOC ID BRA-0004-V1-EN-DEMJ) and a document change request (Form DCR-01); however, your firm has not provided design change procedures to ensure all your design change requirements can be met. In response to this letter, please provide updates and supporting documentation of your corrective actions as they are implemented.\n\n3.    Failure to review, evaluate, and investigate complaints involving the possible failure of a device to meet any of its specifications where necessary, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(c).\n\nSpecifically, your firm has not established a complaint handling procedure. Our investigator reviewed 31 complaint files and 23 of them were associated with failures of your Dermo-Jet Needleless Injectors in administering local anesthesia through intra-dermal injection to patients.  For example, complaint/repair forms (SN45139, SN43812, and SN43824) pertain to your device failing to fire, penetrate, or inject medication as intended during operation. Your firm replaced the devices citing normal wear and tear from usage without investigating to determine whether the device, labeling, or its packaging failed to meet the product specifications.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm submitted procedures for Medical Device Reporting requirements (Doc. No. MDRR0.001, Rev. 001) and the Complaint/Repair Form (ROB-25). However, your procedure focuses on MDR reporting and does not incorporate a complaint handling process as required by 21 CFR 820.198.   You have not provided corrections pertaining to your device’s failure to deliver medication as intended.  You have not indicated your intention to conduct retrospective review of complaints to determine if an investigation is needed.  In response to this letter, please provide updates and supporting documentation of your corrective actions as they are implemented.\n\n4.    Failure to establish device history record to demonstrate that the device was manufactured in accordance with the device master record, as required by 21 CFR 820.184.\n\nSpecifically, your firm has not established procedures to ensure that device history records (DHRs) are properly maintained. Your firm stated the invoices of the assembled/manufactured Dermo-Jet Needleless Injectors are your DHR.  These invoices do not have the DHR elements outlined in Part 820.184, such as date of manufacture, quantity manufactured, quantity released for distribution, acceptance records, primary identification label and labeling used for production units.  For example, your Dermo-Jet Needleless Injector acceptance records does not include testings performed such as rapidity, dosage size, reservoir capacity, weight, dimensions, etc. prior to final release. Your Dermo-Jet Design Specifications Sheet (#20) have these settings documented as design requirements for the proper functioning of your device. \nWe reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm provided a Device History Record procedure (Doc. No. DHR.001, Rev. 001), however, there is no reference to acceptance records, such as testing for rapidity, dosage size, reservoir capacity, weight, and dimensions, to ensure device is manufactured in accordance with the DMR. In response to this letter, please provide updates and supporting documentation of your corrective actions as they are implemented.\n\n5.    Failure to adequately document and maintain acceptance activities as part of the device history record, as required by 21 CFR 820.80(e).\n\nSpecifically, your firm has not established procedures for acceptance activities such that inspections, tests, or other verification activities are performed to ensure compliance with specified requirements. The acceptance activities for receiving, in-process, and finished device acceptance are not documented in the DHR.  For example, in-process activities such as the Ultrasonic Cleaner and Dryer Instrument times are not documented as stated by your Service Technicians and per your Dermo-Jet Assembly Procedure (#06). This equipment has not been validated.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm provided your Acceptance Activity procedure (Doc. No. AAP.001, Ver. 001) outlining the process for accounting, verifying, and inspecting all incoming components. This procedure applies to components used to assemble or repair a Dermo-Jet device, but it does not adequately include provisions for inspection, testing, or other verification activities pertaining to finished devices. In response to this letter, please provide updates and supporting documentation of your corrective actions as they are implemented.\n\n6.    Failure to establish procedures to control labeling activities, as required by 21 CFR 820.120.\n\nSpecifically, your firm failed to define the requirements for conducting labeling reviews and overseeing labeling activities in your Labeling and Packing procedure (#10). For example, your procedure does not define how labels are printed and applied to remain legible and affixed during processing, storage, handling, and distribution; it does not define label/labeling inspection and release criteria; and it does not include labeling storage requirements for proper identification and is designed to prevent mix-ups.  Your employee who prints and affixes label stated he does not review labels for content accuracy or assess if changes are made.  \n\nWe reviewed your firm’s responses and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm provided the Dermo-Jet Labeling procedure (Doc. No DL0.001, Ver 001) and a draft Dermo-Jet label as part of your corrective actions. Your procedure instructs that the Dermo-Jet boxes are labeled correctly to ensure that the UDI, serial number, lot number, and manufacturer information is affixed on all shipping boxes. However, your procedure lacks detail concerning label integrity, inspection of labels, and storage requirements to control labeling activities. Also, your draft Dermo-Jet label does not contain UDI information but a QR Code without any additional information.  In response to this letter, please provide updates and supporting documentation of your corrective actions as they are implemented.\n\nObservations Pertaining to Other Regulations\n\nMedical Device Reporting Violation\n\nOur inspection also revealed that your firm’s Dermo-Jet Needleless Injectors are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 - Medical Device Reporting.  Significant violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nFailure to develop, maintain, and implement written MDR procedures as required by 21 CFR 803.17. For example, during the inspection, your firm presented a two-page document titled “Summary of MDR Reporting Requirement for Manufacturers” as your written MDR procedure. However, upon review, it was determined that while the document references the 21 CFR 803.17 regulations, it does not provide information to demonstrate that it was developed as an MDR procedure in accordance with the requirements in 21 CFR 803.17.\n\nAdditionally, your firm is recommended to establish an active Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG) production account for the electronic submission of MDR reports. FDA verified that, as of October 20, 2024, your firm does not have such an account. Information about the ESG can be found at: How to Enroll in eMDR Program | FDA.\n\nThe adequacy of your firm’s response dated June 21, 2024, cannot be determined at this time. The response notes that your firm plans to develop a procedure to address the requirements of 21 CFR 803.17. However, no procedure was attached to the response, as the corrective action is still in progress.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s response dated July 18, 2024, and conclude that it is not adequate. In the response, your firm includes a newly developed MDR procedure titled “MDR Reporting Requirements”, Document No. MDRR0.001, Version 001, dated July 9, 2024. After reviewing the procedure, the following deficiencies were noted:\n\n1.    Your procedure does not establish internal systems that provide for timely and effective identification, communication, and evaluation of events that may be subject to MDR requirements, as required by 21 CFR 803.17(a)(1).\n\na.    Your procedure omits definitions of the terms ‘become aware’, and ‘caused or contributed’, and the definition for the term ‘reasonably suggests’, found in 803.20(c)(1). The exclusion of the definitions for these terms from the procedure may lead your firm to make an incorrect reportability decision when evaluating a complaint that may meet the criteria for reporting under 21 CFR 803.50(a). \nb.    Your procedure does not include instructions for how your firm will evaluate information about an event to make MDR reportability determinations in a timely manner.\n\n2.    Your procedure does not establish internal systems that provide for a standardized review process to determine when an event meets the criteria for reporting under this part, as required by 21 CFR 803.17(a)(2). For example, your procedure does not specify who makes the decision for reporting events to FDA.\n\n3.    Your procedure does not establish internal systems that provide for timely transmission of complete medical device reports, as required by 21 CFR 803.17(a)(3). Specifically, your procedure does not include instructions for how to obtain the FDA 3500A form.\n\n4.    Your procedure does not describe how your firm will address documentation and record keeping requirements, as required by 21 CFR 803.17(b), including: \n        \na.    Documentation of adverse event related information maintained as MDR event files. \nb.    Documentation of the deliberations and decision-making processes used to determine if a device-related death, serious injury, or malfunction was or was not reportable, as required under 21 CFR 803.18(b)(1)(i).\n\nAdditionally, your procedure includes a reference to submit MDRs to FDA via paper mail, and we recommend that all references to paper submissions be removed from your firm’s MDR procedure. \n\nFurthermore, your procedure includes a reference to submit a 10-workday report for reportable events involving death or serious injury. Please note that, under 21 CFR 803.10(c)(1), reports of death or serious injury must still be submitted within the 30-calendar days of the firm becoming aware of the event. We recommend your firm update the procedure to reflect the requirement.\n\nYour firm’s response dated August 15, 2024, did not provide any new information addressing the noted deficiencies.\n\nMisbranding under Section 502(t)(2) for Failure to Submit Required Information to GUDID\n\nThe Dermo-Jet devices are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that there was a failure or refusal to furnish any material or information required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, respecting these devices. In particular, 21 CFR 801.20(a) requires, with exceptions not relevant here, that the label and device package of every medical device bear a unique device identifier (UDI) that meets the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801, subpart B, and 21 CFR Part 830. Also, 21 CFR 830.300(a) and 830.320(b) – both of which were promulgated under section 519 of the Act, among other provisions – require that the labeler of a device submit electronically to FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) the information required by 21 CFR Part 830, subpart E, for each version or model required to bear a UDI.\n\nFDA has determined that your firm causes a label to be applied to Dermo-Jet devices with the intent that the devices will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and/or causes the label of a device to be replaced or modified with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label (except that the addition of the name of, and contact information for, a person who distributes the device, without making any other changes to the label, is not a modification for the purposes of determining whether a person is a labeler). Robbins Instruments LLC is therefore a “labeler” within the meaning of 21 CFR 830.3 and has not submitted to GUDID information required by 21 CFR Part 830, subpart E, respecting these devices.\n\nThe failure or refusal to furnish any notification or other material or information required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, also constitutes a prohibited act under section 301(q)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(q)(1)(B).\n\nBased on review of the Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) on October 22, 2024, there are no entries for Robbins Instruments LLC or for devices with the trade names Dermo-Jet or any other injector associated with Robbins Instruments LLC. A search of GUDID was performed using the terms Robbins, Instruments, AKRA, Dermo-Jet, DJ05, injector, and KZE, and no relevant results were found. There are 32 entries in GUDID for the company name Robbins Instruments Inc, however none of the 32 entries is for the Dermo-Jet devices or any other injector.\n\nYour firm’s responses dated June 21, 2024, July 18, 2024, and August 15, 2024, are not adequate. Your firm’s response does not address GUDID reporting.\n\nMedical Device Registration and Listing Violation\n\nUnder section 510 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360), manufacturers of medical devices are required to annually register with the FDA.  In September 2007, section 510 of the Act was amended by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-85) to require domestic and foreign device establishments to submit their annual establishment registration and device listing information to FDA by electronic means [section 510(p) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360(p))] during the period beginning October 1st and ending December 31st of each year.  Our records indicate that your firm has not adequately fulfilled annual registration and listing requirements for fiscal year 2024.\n\nTherefore, all your firm’s devices are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(o) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(0)), in that the devices were manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed in an establishment not duly registered under section 510 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360) and were not included in a list required by section 510(j) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 360(j)). For example, the violation includes:\n\nYour firm is registered as an initial distributor/importer for 2024, which does not align with your current type of operation. Our inspection revealed that your firm is engaged in manufacturing activities of your Dermo-Jet Needleless Injectors. Your firm is therefore required to annually register as a manufacturer and list the Dermo-Jet and other medical devices with the FDA.\n\nYour firm should take prompt action to address any violations identified in this letter. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Other federal agencies may take your compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations into account when considering the award of federal contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been addressed. Should FDA determine that your devices or facilities do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to address the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address any violations included in this Warning Letter. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration as part of your response.\n\nYour firm’s response should be sent via email to Establishment Assessment Team Assistant Director, Jessica Mu, at CDRHEnforcement@fda.hhs.gov. Please include in the subject line, the CMS Case #687984 when replying. If you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Compliance Officer, Charles J. Chacko at 214-253-4939, or via email at charles.chacko@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility.  It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA.  The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems.  Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of any violations and take prompt actions to address any violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\nRDML Sean Boyd, MPH, USPHS\nDirector\nOffice of Regulatory Programs\nOffice of Product Evaluation and Quality\nCenter for Device and Radiological Health\n\n ",
