Additionally, we reviewed product listings on your Amazon storefront, which you operate under the name, Keto Kerri, as well as the literature accompanying sales of your products.\n\nThe claims on your website, social media webpage, Amazon storefront, and literature included with a product sale establish that your products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.\n\nExamples of some of the claims observed on your website, www.ketokerri.com, that provide evidence that these products are intended for use as drugs include the following:\n\nUnder the heading for “CLEAN MCT C8 OIL”:\n\n“NATURAL ANTIBIOTIC: used in industry to kill pathogens”\n\nUnder the heading for “KK Clean Clay”:\n\n“A pure calcium bentonite green clay, such as KK Clean Clay™ . . . has strong ionic properties that bind (chelate) molecules such as heavy metals, toxins and pathogens and holds them till they are removed from the body.”\n“The clay reduces diarrhea”\n\nUnder the heading for “KK Humic/Fulvic”:\n\n“Cancer Fighter: the cancer fighting capacity of HA and FA”\nANCIENT ORIGINS The medicinal qualities exhibited by the ancient remedy Shilajit are due to the presence of Humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) . . . Shilajit has been used in oriental medicine for centuries to treat . . . diabetes, skin diseases, rheumatic pain, kidney stones, heart ailments, leprosy . . . .”\n“MICROBIAL MUTAGENIC DEFENSE FA has antimicrobial and antibacterial properties … antiviral properties”\n\nUnder the heading for “KK MSM”:\n\n“People take MSM by mouth for chronic pain, osteoarthritis, joint inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, inflammation around the joints (bursitis), tendinitis, swelling around the tendons (tenosynovitis), musculoskeletal pain, muscle cramps, hardened skin condition called scleroderma . . . hair loss . . . eye inflammation … gum disease, wounds, cuts, and abrasions/accelerated wound healing, RA (rheumatoid arthritis), carpal tunnel syndrome, asthma, allergies, muscle cramps/pain . . . eczema, rosacea, psoriasis.”\n“People also take MSM by mouth for relief of allergies, chronic constipation, “sour stomach”, ulcers, a bowel disease called diverticulosis . . . obesity, poor circulation, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, liver problems, Alzheimer’s disease . . . lung disorders including emphysema and pneumonia, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythematous), HIV infection and AIDS, and cancer (breast cancer and colon cancer), mucous membrane inflammation, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) problems, leg cramps, migraine, headaches, hangover, parasitic infections of the intestinal and urogenital tracts including Trichomonas vaginalis and Giardia, yeast infection, insect bites, radiation poisoning . . . .”\n\nYour website also includes disease claims in the form of citations to publications or references. When scientific publications or references are used commercially by the seller of a product to promote the product to consumers, such references may become evidence of the product's intended use. For example, under 21 CFR 101.93(g)(2)(iv)(C), a citation of a publication or reference in the labeling of a product is considered to be a claim about disease treatment or prevention if the citation refers to a disease use and if, in the context of the labeling as a whole, the citation implies treatment or prevention of a disease. The following examples of citations on your website used to market “KK Black Seed Oil” and “KK Humic/Fulvic Minerals & Electrolytes” for disease treatment or prevention are evidence of your products’ intended use as drugs:\n\nUnder the heading for “KK Black Seed Oil”:\n\n“Diabetes: the anti-diabetic capacity of BSO”\n“VERSATILE Black seed oil has been used to treat almost any disease or condition. These include asthma, eczema, inflammation, diabetes, influenza, rheumatism, gastrointestinal issues, cancer, hypertension, neurological issues, and many more”\n“MICROBIAL DEFENSE Black seed oil can act as an Antibacterial agent, Antiviral agent, Antifungal agent, Antiparasitic agent”\n“Yimer EM, Tuem KB, Karim A, Ur-Rehman N, Anwar F (2019). “Nigella sativa L. (Black Cumin): A Promising Natural Remedy for Wide Range of Illnesses,” Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, vol. 2019, Article ID 1528635, 16 pages, 2019 reviewed 21 studies [referencing footnotes 9-31 on the page] exploring the potential of black seed oil (Nigella sativa [NS] and Thymoquinone [TQ] [a component of black seed oil]) in five specific neurological areas: Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Depression and anxiety, Epilepsy, and Opioid Dependence and Tolerance. The review concluded NS and TQ held great promise for improvement in these areas [referencing footnote 6 on the page].”\n“GUT HEALTH Animal and human studies have shown NS and TQ have broad gastroprotective and restorative potentials [referencing footnotes 3, 5, and 6 on the page]. These include treatments for Celiac disease, dyspepsia, and other common ailments.”\n“DIABETES Many of the properties exhibited by black seed oil have the potential to be helpful in the management and treatment of diabetes [referencing footnotes 6 and 7 on the page] . . . it has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol . . ..”\n“Aljabre SH, Alakloby OM, Randhawa MA (2015). “Dermatological effects of Nigella sativa,” Journal of Dermatology & Dermatologic Surgery, vol. 19, no. 2, pp. 92–96, 2015 examined all of the current studies and articles relating to NS and TQ as they relate to the skin. The article focused on ten areas of interest: antibacterial properties, the antiviral properties, the antifungal properties, the antiparasitic properties, wound healing, psoriasis … allergic reactions, eczema, and skin cancer. The article concluded, “The published original research articles on the effects of N. sativa and its ingredients strongly indicate its pharmacological potential in dermatology” [referencing footnote 47 on the page].”\n“Yimer EM, Tuem KB, Karim A, Ur-Rehman N, Anwar F (2019). “Nigella sativa L. (Black Cumin): A Promising Natural Remedy for Wide Range of Illnesses,” Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, vol. 2019, Article ID 1528635, 16 pages, 2019 reviewed 15 studies [referencing footnotes 32-46 on the page] to assess the role NS and TQ can play in fighting cancer. . . . The review determined that NS and TQ can help alleviate the side effects of conventional therapies and can act on all major cancer markers [referencing footnote 6 on the page].”\n\nOn the webpage, www.ketokerri.com/kk-black-seed-oil/, under the header “FOOTNOTES”:\n\nFootnote 30: Sharaf R, Elsayed MN, Mahran L (2014). “Neuroprotective effect of thymoquinone against lipopolysaccharide-induced Alzheimer’s disease in an animal model,” European Geriatric Medicine, vol. 5, no. 1, pp. S83-S158, 2014.\nFootnote 35: Gali-Muhtasib H, Ocker M, Kuester D, et al.

For example:\n\nSpanish\n\nNovember 20, 2019 Post: “Lamentablemente más del 90% de los niños con TEA tienen deficiencia de acido clorhídrico en el estomago.

Helps to detoxify chemicals, toxins, cancer.”\n\nFurthermore, you provide product purchase links from your website www.ketokerri.com, to your Amazon storefront, which you operated under the name, Keto Kerri. The product descriptions provide evidence that these products are intended for use as drugs include the following:\n\nOn the “KK Humic/Fulvic Minerals & Electrolytes” product listing:\n\n“Fulvic and Humic Acids are the best solution to . . .absorbing the minerals and electrolytes[.] . . . A Few Symptoms That May Indicate Mineral Deficiency: . . . Depression . . .Arthritis . . . Heart Palpitations . . .Allergies . . .Asthma[,] Glucose, Cholesterol, or Anemia Problems[.]”\n\nOn the “KK Breakthrough Vitamin D with CHONDROITIN & OLEIC” product listing:\n\n“The latest Breakthrough in Vitamin D supplementation . . . A Few Symptoms That May Indicate Vitamin D Deficiency: . . .Diarrhea . . . Inflammation . . . Fibromyalgia, [and] Chronic Fatigue Syndrome[.]”\n\nYour products “Dr. Fitt Robynzyme,” “Level Up Clean MCT C8 Oil,” “KK Black Seed Oil,” “KK Breakthrough Vitamin D with CHONDROITIN & OLEIC,” “KK Clean Clay™,” “KK EDTA with Selenium & Minerals,” “KK Humic/Fulvic Minerals & Electrolytes,” and “KK 99.9% Pure Organic Sulfur Crystals MSM” are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 C.F.R. § 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour products “Dr. Fitt Robynzyme,” “KK Black Seed Oil,” “KK Breakthrough Vitamin D with CHONDROITIN & OLEIC,” “KK EDTA with Selenium & Minerals,” “KK Humic/Fulvic Minerals & Electrolytes,” and “KK 99.9% Pure Organic Sulfur Crystals MSM” are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your “Dr. Fitt Robynzyme,” “KK Black Seed Oil,” “KK Breakthrough Vitamin D with CHONDROITIN & OLEIC,” “KK EDTA with Selenium & Minerals,” “KK Humic/Fulvic Minerals & Electrolytes,” and “KK 99.9% Pure Organic Sulfur Crystals MSM” products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including the Act and FDA regulations.\n\nYou should take prompt action to correct the violations in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.\n\nWithin fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations.
