When turning the light of Ayurveda onto HBP, there is a priority toward each person’s imbalance and recommendations are made based on the best diet and activities for each person. For a deeper understanding let’s take a closer look at what high blood pressure really is.”\n2\nThis webpage is also linked from a post on your LinkedIn social media website, which states, “Ayurveda calls high blood sugar Madhumeha, which is similar to type 2 diabetes. With type 2, the person lacks the ability to properly use insulin and excess glucose builds up in the blood. The kidneys try to compensate and some of the excess glucose is removed by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Reduced insulin production and decreased insulin sensitivity are the contributing factors for madhumeha known as Hyperglycemia or high blood sugar.”\n3\nSimilar claims appear on your Instagram post dated July 13, 2016.\n4\nThis webpage is also linked from your Facebook post dated February 21, 2022, which states “Do you suffer from PCOS?

In Ayurveda, there are multiple herbs and lifestyle changes that can be done to relieve symptoms of PCOS.” Similar claims also appear on your twitter post dated February 21, 2022.\n5\nThis webpage is also linked from your Facebook post, dated January 18, 2022, which states “Ayurveda utilizes a very special therapy that builds strength and nourishes the bones, muscles, joints and nerves and improves flexibility and movement. The therapy is called Abhyanga, which is a full body oil massage followed by steam bathing or warm water bathing. The heat from the warm steam or water helps the oil penetrate deeply into the layers of skin and tissues. When Abhyanga therapy is done daily, there is profound relief from pain, stiffness, inflammation, and nerve degeneration.” Similar claims also appear on a post on your LinkedIn social media website.",
