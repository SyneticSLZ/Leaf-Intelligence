The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your website at the internet address https://totaltoltrazuril.com/ from December 2023 through May 2024, and has determined that you offer this product for sale there.\n\nBased on our review of your website at the internet address https://totaltoltrazuril.com/, your product is a drug under section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)], because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. For the reasons described below, this product is an unapproved new animal drug and introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nYou can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\n\nExamples of claims FDA observed on your website and product labeling that show the intended use of your product include the following:\n\nFrom your home website at the URL https://totaltoltrazuril.com/:\n• “THE SOLUTION IS TOTAL TOLTRAZURIL! GET THE SOLUTION! …GREAT FOR All your 4 legged companions…”\n• “…Toltrazuril is the result of extensive research efforts to help treat EPM (equine protozoal myeloencephalitis) & Coccidiosis. Toltrazuril can be used `as both a preventative and a treatment for disease…”\n• “…usually does not require follow-up treatment, even in advanced infections (after three to five days)…”\n• “…the efficacy of the drug is independent from the severity of the infection…”\n• “…Toltrazuril has a unique mode of action and there is no reason to be concerned with an adverse reaction or a drug-drug reaction. As Toltrazuril only has activity against protozoa, there is no effect on upset of intestinal flora and the formulation is very well tolerated…”\n• “…It is recommended to repeat the treatment weekly for a couple of weeks. It is CRITICAL to clean the environment to rid it of coccidia…”\n• “…Combats Coccidia Keep your animals safe from Coccidiosis!”\n• “…Safe For Use No reported cases of this product ever harming or killing an animal”\n\nFrom your webpage titled “Total Toltrazuril - Coccidiosis & Horse EPM Treatment” at the URL https://totaltoltrazuril.com/products/total-toltrazuril:\n• “Total Toltrazuril – Coccidiosis & Horse EPM Treatment”\n• “Total Toltrazuril is a preventative and treatment for both coccidiosis and equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM)”\n\nOn your social media webpages at the URLs https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=650999707226061&set=pb.100069481117087.-2207520000, https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8xN9QR1/ and https://www.instagram.com/totaltoltrazuril/p/C0z17TfMiMm/:\n• On your December 13, 2023, Facebook and Instagram posts: “…Total Toltrazuril effectively and safely combats Coccidia and eradicates EPM in your animals…”\n• On your November 16, 2023, Facebook post: “…Toltrazuril is safe for a wide variety of animals, including horses, dogs, goats, sheep, chickens, cattle & more…”\n• On your November 8, 2023, Facebook post: “…Toltrazuril is the result of extensive research efforts to help treat and prevent EPM and Coccidiosis in animals! …is easy to apply & is safe for your animals…”\n• On your November 2, 2023, Facebook post: ”… Our solution acts as both a preventative and treatment against coccidiosis and EPM…”\n• On your January 23, 2022, Facebook post: “…Having issues with Coccidia or EPM? We can help! DM for current coupon code! #toltrazuril #totaltoltrazuril #coccidiosis #epm…”\n• On your November 8, 2021, Facebook post: “…adult chickens can also be infected with the disease and pass it on to other members of the flock through their droppings. Check our site for toltrazuril as a treatment and preventative…”\n• On your October 29, 2021, TikTok post with an infographic that states “…EPM – COCCIDIA – COCCIDIOSIS Are these affecting your animals and CORID is not working? Try our Total Toltrazuril…”\n\nYour product is a new animal drug under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. 321(v)], because it is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. This product is not approved or index listed by FDA, and therefore, the product is unsafe within the meaning of section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)], and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated drug is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product.
