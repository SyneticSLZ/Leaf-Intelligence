We also conducted an inspection on November 22, 2019. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 1 subpart L.\n\nThe FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food they import into the United States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals.\n\nDuring our most recent inspection, we found that you are not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1 subpart L for your dried black fungus imported from your foreign supplier (b)(4), located in (b)(4); and mix candy and Glam Day lollipops imported from your foreign supplier (b)(4), located in (b)(4). Because of these significant violations, you are not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act.\n\nAt the conclusion of both the initial FSVP inspection on November 22, 2019 and the follow-up inspection on March 24, 2021, our investigator provided you in each instance with a Form FDA 483a, FSVP Observations. As of the date of this letter, we have not received your response to the most recently issued Form FDA 483a.\nYour significant violations of the FSVP regulation are as follows:\n\n1. You did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). Specifically, you did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP for the following foods:\n• Mix candy and Glam Day lollipops imported from (b)(4), located in (b)(4).\n\n2. You did not meet the requirements to conduct and document (or obtain documentation of) one or more of the supplier verification activities listed in 21 CFR 1.506(e)(1)(i) through (iv) for each foreign supplier before importing the food and periodically thereafter, as required by 21 CFR 1.506(e)(1). Specifically, you did not conduct and document (or obtain documentation of) one or more supplier verification activities for your foreign supplier (b)(4) before importing dried black fungus and periodically thereafter.\n\nThe above violations are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1 subpart L.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in further action. For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food products you import for which you appear to be in violation of section 805. We may place the foods you import from the identified foreign suppliers on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the products. You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert # 99-41 at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for importation into the United States of an article of food without the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act.\n\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should address the specific things you are doing to correct any violations. You should include in your response documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a copy of your revised FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), and any additional information that you wish to supply relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you believe that you are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations.\n\nPlease send your reply to Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Slater Bartlett, FDA Compliance Officer; Division of Northeast Imports: ORAOEIONEIMPORTSWLResponses@fda.hhs.gov. Please also cc (carbon copy) slater.bartlett@fda.hhs.gov. If you have any questions regarding this letter, you may contact Compliance Officer Bartlett via email at slater.bartlett@fda.hhs.gov. Please reference CMS # 614474 on any documents or records you provide to us and/or within the subject line of any email correspondence you send to us.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nDawne Hines\nProgram Division Director\nDivision of Northeast Imports",
