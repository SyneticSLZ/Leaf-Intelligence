Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nThis inspection revealed that the VERlGENE Processor SP System is adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\n\nWe received your written responses dated March 9, April 10, May 8, and June 9, 2020 from Nachum \"Homi\" Shamir, President and CEO, and Steve Back, VP, Global Quality Assurance, Regulatory, and Global Management Representative, concerning our investigator's observations noted on the Form FDA 483, List of Inspectional Observations issued to the two facilities listed above. We address these responses below in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nQuality System Regulation:\n\n1. Failure to validate a process when changes or process deviations occurred, as required by 21 CFR § 820.75(c).\n\nSpecifically, your firm has not adequately validated, reviewed, or approved the manufacturer change for the calibration heater test fixtures. Heater fixtures made by your firm were validated to calibrate and verify the VERIGENE SP class II medical device for clinical multiplex test systems in 2013. Since approximately March 2019, your firm began using heater fixtures produced by a new component manufacturer, (b)(4), to calibrate and verify the VERIGENE SP instruments. However, you implemented this change without an approved validation plan or validation report, in contrast to the requirements in your Process Validation Standard Operating Procedure (00345, Rev. S). Your Hybridization Control Validation Study ((b)(4)) describes that (b)(4) is critical for precisely controlling the hybridization assay temperature and effectiveness of the Verigene SP instrument. Furthermore, the new heater fixture uses an (b)(4) for heater fixture QC processes compared to the (b)(4) QC process used by the previous heater fixture. You did not have validation records supporting the equivalency of the (b)(4) QC method used in the heater fixture QC process.\n\nWe have reviewed your firm's responses and conclude they are not adequate. In your responses, you indicated you opened CAP A LMNX-20-006 to address this observation however, your validation activities for the (b)(4) assembled Heater Test Fixtures does not appear to fully address this observation. For example: 1) Your validation report (GV AL-0008-01) appears to compare (b)(4) and (b)(4) fixtures but it does not address process changes between the two heating fixtures; 2) There is no statistical rationale why a minimum number of (b)(4) heater fixtures were tested for the (b)(4) types of fixture assemblies; 3) It is unclear how you identified the (b)(4) rationale when field data ((b)(4)) had (b)(4) heater verification failures ((b)(4)% rate) prior to using the (b)(4) built fixtures, and how you determined your (b)(4) only requires a verification script of (b)(4) to PASS; 4) Your validation report failed to document process deviations observed during the sample well and hybridization heater fixture validation; you did not investigate these deviations to determine if revalidation is needed, where appropriate.\n\n2. Failure to adequately establish procedures for corrective and preventive action, as required by 21 CFR § 820.100(a).\n\nSpecifically, your firm's personnel have not adequately followed the Corrective and Preventive Action Standard Operating Procedure (00283) that requires immediate containment of the affected product or process without undue delay. For example, CAPA LMNX-CAPA-18-017 was opened on 10/18/2018 to address false negative results with your VERIGENE heat calibration fixtures. Your CAPA investigation stated that significant differences were observed in qualification and build of the fixtures. Your investigation data supported that inadequately validated heater fixtures may negatively affect assay performance on VERIGENE SP instruments. However, your CAPA LMNXZ-CAPA-18-017 has not documented any actions or considerations to contain suspect VERIGENE SP instruments that have been distributed and serviced using the inadequately validated heater fixtures. Inadequately validated heater fixtures have been used to calibrate/verify VERIGENE SP instruments since approximately March 2019.\n\nWe have reviewed your firm's responses and the adequacy of your implemented corrective actions cannot be determined at this time. In your responses, you indicated you opened CAPA # LMNX-20-007 to address this observation. You indicated you have updated your CAPA SOP 00283, your CAPA Program Management Point-of-Use Instruction 03289, and your CAPA template 00281. In addition, you indicate you have conducted an assessment of your open CAPAs and have identified (b)(4) CAPAs that were in need of a reassessment of risk and containment actions. The effectiveness of corrective actions you have taken will be evaluated during your next inspection.\n\n3. Failure to adequately establish procedures or instructions for performing servicing activities and verifying that servicing meets specified requirements, as required by 21 CFR § 820.200(a).\n\nSpecifically, your firm has not kept calibration records and verification results on device servicing since 2016. Your VERIGENE Reader and VERIGENE SP System (NSP-FSM-0001-1 and NSP-FSM-0001-6) requires auto test for Sample Well Calibration, Elution Well Calibration, Amplification Well Calibration, and Hybridization Well Calibration. Your firm has logged approximately (b)(4) service visits since January 2018 and has not implemented your procedures in providing test and inspection data. For example:\n\nYour service manual states that (b)(4) on all heater verification results must be attached to Field Service Reports, however, your Field Service Reports for thermal failures did not include (b)(4) data. Your firm failed to keep naplog records (autotest data that keeps records of failures during the calibration and verification) of calibration and verification on your device servicing. There is only a \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" status in your (b)(4) salesforce database that your Field Service Engineers records.\n\nWe reviewed your firm's responses and conclude that they are not adequate. You indicated you initiated a CAPA #LMNX-20-005 to address this observation but you did not submit supporting documentation of your proposed corrections. In response to this Warning Letter, please provide records of your CAPA activities to include root cause analysis, corrective and preventative plan and effectiveness checks. Please also include your complete Service Manual updates and how its implemented, including but not limited to, training field service employees on Field Service Procedure (OP 00014), updated Field Service Advisories, and (b)(4) functionality updates.\n\n4. Failure to adequately establish procedures to ensure that all purchased or otherwise received product and services conform to specified requirements, as required by 21 CFR § 820.50.\n\nSpecifically, you did not establish and maintain quality requirements that must be met by your suppliers. Your Supplier Qualification and Management Standard Operating Procedure (DOC. #01836, Rev. T) requires a minimum of an accepted Supplier Survey for a Class (b)(4) or Class (b)(4) supplier. However, your firm did not document the selection and evaluation of your critical supplier. For example:\n\na. There are no documents (i.e. Supplier Approval Form) for the selection and evaluation of (b)(4) (Class (b)(4) supplier) that manufactures Heater Calibration Fixtures for the VERIGENE Processor SP System.\n\nb. You have not established or maintained purchasing data that describes or references the specified requirements, including a quality agreement that firm's suppliers agree to notify you of changes in the product or services that may affect the quality of the product.\n\nWe reviewed your firm's responses and conclude that it is not adequate. You indicated you opened a CAPA #LMNX-20-003 to address this observation. However, the (b)(4) Service Supplier Survey (dated 2/18/20) indicates that there is no service contract or a procedure in place to renew contracts prior to expiration. In response to this Warning Letter, please submit supporting information and documents on how you are evaluating (b)(4) as a critical supplier, including supplier and quality agreement with (b)(4) that defines the type and extent of control to be exercised over the product and services. In addition, your supplier audit report does not indicate you are evaluating the suppliers under Quality System requirements.\n\n5. Failure to establish procedures for monitoring and control of process parameters for a validated process as required by 21 CFR § 820.75(b).\n\nSpecifically, your firm's field service engineers have not been adequately monitoring which heater fixture is used for calibration and which heater fixture is used for verification since approximately 2018. This is in contrast to Process Validation Standard Operating Procedure ((b)(4)) that requires (b)(4) of validated processes, and in contrast to VERIGENE System Service Manual ((b)(4)) that requires (b)(4) to be used for calibration and verification of VERIGENE SP instruments.\n\nWe reviewed your firm's responses and adequacy of your implemented corrective actions cannot be determined at this time. In your responses, you indicated you opened CAPA# LMNX-20-005 to address this observation. You have issued Field Service Advisory (FSA) (b)(4), and you have issued Field Service Advisory (b)(4). The effectiveness of corrective actions you have taken will be evaluated during your next inspection.\n\nCorrections and Removals Regulation:\n\nOur inspection also revealed that your firm's VERIGENE SP Processor device is misbranded under section 502(1)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2)], in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device, as required under section 519 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 360(i)], and Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 806 - Medical Devices; Reports of Corrections and Removals. Violations include failure to submit a written report of a correction or removal of a device initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, or to remedy a violation of the Act caused by the device, which may present a risk to health, as required by 21 CFR 806.10. For example, your firm's personnel removed the following malfunctioned VERIGENE SP instruments from point of use and have not submitted a Report of Correction or Removal to FDA for these actions:\n\na. VERIGENE SP Processor Serial No. (b)(4) was serviced at the point of use, and after subsequent failure, was returned to your firm in Northbrook, IL on (b)(6), (b)(7)(C). Medical Device Report (MDR) 3006028115-2019-00002 was filed after a patient died and a malfunction which resulted in delay of therapy due to false negative results of the firm's (b)(4) assays using the VERIGENE SP instrument was reported. Two days later, blood culture identified Pseudomonas further testing reported multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas. (b)(4). The patient died two days later.\n\nAdditional information provided in the associated customer complaint, case number 00663860, identified multiple false negative reported results on this instrument after the MDR event. The Field Service Engineer found the (b)(4) failed verification and need to be recalibrated and the (b)(4). Repairs were made and the instrument passed all verification testing. Thereafter, another false negative result was reported on a quality control sample and the instrument was returned. Documentation of testing of the returned instrument shows the (b)(4) did not pass verification testing. After some investigation your firm confirmed the customer-reported malfunction and determined that the VERIGENE SP Serial No. (b)(4) could not detect Pseudomonas aeruginosa in three separate positive samples.\n\nThe false negative device result may have led to a missed opportunity to initiate effective treatment earlier. The risk of false negative results could be the inappropriate de-escalation or lack of escalation of antibiotic therapy until subculture sensitivity testing was completed. The associated customer complaint, case number (b)(4), states that your firm issued work orders on the implicated VERIGENE SP instrument for repair onsite, and then for return to the firm. FDA finds that the removal of this instrument was initiated to reduce a risk to health, and this was not reported to FDA.\n\nb. Field service was conducted on the VERIGENE SP Processor Serial No. (b)(4) due to a customer complaint of thermal control failure. The field service report stated the FSE replaced (b)(4) and ran all tests as passed. Subsequently, the customer reported the initial service was ineffective. The VERIGENE SP Processor was then removed from the customer site and returned for analysis. As exemplified in the MDR associated with Serial No. (b)(4), a (b)(4) that does not meet specifications could contribute to \"(b)(4)\" and other potentially discrepant results, including false negative results. FDA finds that the removal of this instrument was initiated to reduce a risk to health, and this was not reported to FDA.\n\nYour firm failed to notify the FDA of the medical device correction or removal and did not provide the information required by 21 CFR 806.10. Your firm's actions have been reviewed by FDA and determined to meet the risk to health threshold requiring a 21 CFR Part 806 report, as specified in 21 CFR 806.10. Therefore, your firm's actions should have been reported to the FDA.\n\nWe have reviewed your responses, dated March 9, April 10, May 8, and June 9, 2020, to the FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to your firm at the close of the inspection. Your updates to Case (b)(4) include references to (b)(4) and (b)(4), which were not included in your firm's responses. Your firm has also not addressed the removal of VERIGENE SP Processor #(b)(4) and any additional units that should be included within the scope of the recalls. Your firm responses have not included any actions you have taken, or plan to take, to report the medical device removals for these devices and any other corrections or removals that are required to be reported under 21 CFR Part 806.10.\n\nYour firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. Also, should FDA determine that your devices do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, please respond to FDA with your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm's planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm's response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter.\n\nYour firm's response should be sent via e-mail to: US Food and Drug Administration, Division 3/West, Office of Medical Device and Radiological Health Operations at oradevices3firmresponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please identify your response with CMS case #606267 when replying. If you have questions regarding the content of this letter, please contact Compliance Officer, Charles J. Chacko at 214-253-4939, or via email at charles.chacko@f da.hhs. gov.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm's facility. It is your firm's responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm's manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nShari J.
