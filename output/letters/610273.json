The claims on your website establish that your products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Based on our review, your products are unapproved new animal drugs. As discussed below, marketing of unapproved new animal drugs violates the FD&C Act.\n\nExamples of claims observed on your website (www.holistichealthypet.com) that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n\nDoctor’s Best for Your Pets\n• Bee Propolis\n“…propolis which essentially acts as an antibiotic that stops bacteria in its tracks.”\n“…propolis, the natural beeswax additive that acts like an antibiotic.”\n\nSavvy Holistic Health Pet Essences\n• Calming Comfort\n“Use in new situations, on trips, or when your pet can’t relax.

They are not the subject of an approved new\nanimal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. New animal drugs that are not the subject of an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)], and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated drug is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to address this matter may lead to legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nThis letter and FDA’s April 7, 2020, Warning Letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products or operations. Our review of your website indicates that you are offering for sale unapproved animal drugs in addition to those listed above. If FDA takes legal action, the action may address all of your unapproved new animal drugs, not just those listed above. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA’s implementing regulations.\n\nWithin fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to correct any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour response should be sent to Dr. Vic Boddie, United States Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine, Office of Surveillance and Compliance, Division of Compliance by e-mail to Vic.Boddie@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nDr. Amber McCoig\nDeputy Director, Division of Compliance\nCenter for Veterinary Medicine\nFood and Drug Administration",
