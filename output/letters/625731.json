Based on our review, FDA identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act). You can find the Act through links on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdc-act and the FDA regulations at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21.\n\nUnapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs\n\nFDA reviewed your website at www.musclesport.com in May 2022 and September 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for the products CardioBurn For Her Powder, Rhino Rampage Capsules™, Joint Revolution™ Capsules, STRESS B-COMPLEX, IMMUNITY + Powder, and Apple Cider Vinegar Capsules. The claims on this website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. In addition, we observed that your product IMMUNITY + Powder is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191 in people. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\nOn the product webpage for CardioBurn For Her Powder, a product containing green coffee extract (https://musclesport.com/collections/her-series/products/cardioburn-for-her):\n\n“Green coffee extract . . . is a concentrated source of chlorogenic acid, a compound that may be able to reduce blood sugar and have an anti-diabetic effect.

The claims on this website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\nOn the product webpage for THERMX™ Powder, a product containing chromium (https://purgesports.com/collections/purge-products/products/thermx#ingredients):\n\n“Chromium is an essential mineral with a role in insulin regulation and glucose management.

The claims on this website establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include:\n\nOn the product webpage for RECOMP Capsules (https://www.musclemilitia.com/products/recomp):\n\n“Fenugreek [an ingredient in the product] helps . . . manage blood sugar”\n“Fenugreek . . .\n\n    o Decreases blood glucose”\n\n“Berberine [an ingredient in the product] . . .\n\n    o Potent blood glucose, cholesterol . . . reducing abilities”\n\nFDA reviewed your website at www.kodiaksupps.com, which redirects to https://musclesport.com/collections/alpha-series, in May 2022 and September 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Attack™ Pre-Workout Powder and Coma™ Sleep & Recovery Activator Lemon Drop Powder. The claims on this website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.\n\nExamples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:\n\nOn the product webpage for Attack™ Pre-Workout Powder under “Ingredient Profile” (https://musclesport.com/collections/alpha-series/products/attack-pre-workout):\n\n“Citrulline Malate . . . converts to nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator that can help to lower blood pressure . . . .”\n“Arginine . . . has been studied for healing wounds . . . and preventing tissue degradation in people with critical illnesses.”\n\nOn the product webpage for Coma™ Sleep & Recovery Activator Lemon Drop Powder under “Ingredient Profile” (https://musclesport.com/products/coma-sleep-aid):\n\n“Reductions in glycine receptor stimulation or function . . . promote REM sleep behavior disorder.”\n\nYour products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour products CardioBurn For Her Powder, IMMUNITY + Powder, and HYPEX Powder are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, CardioBurn For Her Powder, IMMUNITY + Powder, and HYPEX Powder fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nWe also offer the following comment:\n\nThe Supplement Facts panel of your product RECOMP Capsules declares Bitter Orange Extract (Citrus aurantium) (see musclemilitia.com/products/recomp under Supplement Facts tab), and your product webpage for the RECOMP Capsules states, “Bitter orange extract contains neuroactive agents, synephrine, hordenine, and octopamine” (musclemilitia.com/products/recomp under “Ingredients” tab). Your website does not provide enough information for us to determine whether hordenine and octopamine have been added to RECOMP Capsules as ingredients or are present in trace amounts as components of Bitter Orange Extract. We also do not know whether these compounds are present in their original biogenic form or as synthetically produced salts (e.g., hordenine HCl).\n\nFDA recently sent warning letters to several firms selling dietary supplements containing hordenine, hordenine HCl, or octopamine as ingredients. See “FDA Sends Warning Letters to Multiple Companies for Illegally Selling Adulterated Dietary Supplements” and May 4, 2022 warning letters to, e.g., Ironmag Labs (hordenine) and Max Muscle (hordenine HCl and octopamine). Although FDA does not have enough information at present about the composition of RECOMP Capsules to take a position on whether the product is adulterated because of the presence of hordenine and octopamine, it is your responsibility to take any action necessary to ensure that your distribution and sale of RECOMP Capsules does not violate the Act, including evaluating whether the product contains any substances that render it adulterated.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Lillian C. Aveta, Compliance Officer, 158-15 Liberty Ave., Jamaica, NY 11433 or via email at Lillian.aveta@fda.hhs.gov (preferred). If you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact Ms. Aveta at 718-662-5576 or email atLillian.aveta@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nRonald M. Pace\nProgram Division Director\nOffice of Human and Animal Food Operations\nEast – Division 1\n\n______________________________\n\n1 There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19. Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described in the body of this letter, you sell a product that is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.\n\n2 The Facebook page refers consumers to the Internet address www.optitunenutrition.com, which redirects to https://musclesport.com/collections/general-health.",
