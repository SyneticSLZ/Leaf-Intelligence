Reyna:\n\nOn August 12, 2022, through August 25, 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP) inspection of Compass Logistics, LLC located at 4708 Sweetwater Ave, McAllen, Texas. We also conducted an inspection on October 13, 2020. These inspections were conducted to determine compliance with the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 384a) and the implementing FSVP regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n\nThe FSVP regulation requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that human and/or animal food they import into the United States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. food safety standards. You may find information relating to the FSVP regulation and your responsibilities to comply with the regulation through links in FDA’s FSVP web page at https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-final-rule-foreign-supplier-verification-programs-fsvp-importers-food-humans-and-animals.\n\nDuring the most recent inspection, we found that you were not in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR part 1 subpart L for the foods from the foreign suppliers indicated in the attached list, with the exception of hot sauce imported from (b)(4). Because of these significant violations, you are not in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act.\n\nAt the conclusion of the inspection, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483a FSVP Observations.\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your email response dated September 13, 2022. In your message, which you describe as your initial response, you outline actions you will take to comply with the FSVP regulation. You state that you have hired a consultant who has the appropriate training and experience to facilitate FSVP compliance and that you expect to have full implementation of your FSVP program no later than December 31, 2022. You also state that during the FSVP implementation process, you will review if you import from certain small foreign suppliers and choose to comply with the modified FSVP requirements. We have not received any additional responses from you. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide documentation or evidence of the specific steps you have taken to comply with the FSVP regulation for the food products you import.\n\nYour significant violations of the FSVP regulation are as follows:\n\n1. You did not develop, maintain, and follow an FSVP as required by section 805 of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 1.502(a). Specifically, you did not develop an FSVP for the foods you import from the foreign suppliers indicated in the attached list, except for hot sauce imported from (b)(4), including:\n\n(b)(4) from (b)(4)\n(b)(4) from (b)(4)\n\nYou import fresh produce that is “covered produce” as defined in 21 CFR 112.3. As an importer of covered produce, you must have an FSVP that demonstrates that your supplier is producing the food in compliance with processes and procedures that provide at least the same level of public health protection as those required under section 419 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 350h) (regarding standards for produce safety) and the implementing regulations in the Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption (21 CFR part 112).\n\nThe above violations are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations of the FSVP requirements. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are in compliance with section 805 of the FD&C Act and the implementing regulation in 21 CFR part 1, subpart L.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. If you do not adequately address this matter, we may take further action. For instance, we may take action under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)) to refuse admission of the food you import for which you appear to be in violation of section 805. We may place the foods from the identified foreign suppliers on detention without physical examination (DWPE) when you import the foods. You can find DWPE information relating to FSVP in Import Alert # 99-41 at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/ialist.html. In addition, the importation or offering for importation into the United States of an article of food without the importer having an FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of the FD&C Act or the FSVP regulation is prohibited under section 301(zz) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(zz)).\n\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should address the specific things you are doing to correct any violations. You should include in your response documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections (e.g., documentation of changes you made, such as a copy of your FSVP, records to demonstrate implementation of your FSVP), and any additional information that you wish to supply relevant to your compliance with the FSVP regulation. If you believe that you are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 working days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations.\n\nPlease send your reply to Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Melissa G. Gonzalez, Compliance Officer, the Division of Southwest Imports, 216 West Village Blvd, Suite 107, Laredo, Texas 78041. If you have any questions regarding this letter, you may contact Melissa G. Gonzalez via email at melissag.gonzalez@fda.hhs.gov. Please reference CMS # 644355 on any documents or records you provide to us and within the subject line of any email correspondence you send to us.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nTodd Cato\nProgram Division Director\nDivision of Southwest Imports",
