We also reviewed your IBSolutions product page and seller’s profile page at Amazon.com, and your Facebook pages at www.facebook.com/supernaturalshealth and www.facebook.com/ibsrelief, which are linked to your websites at the internet addresses https://www.supernaturalshealth.com and https://www.ibsformula.com. The claims on your websites, Amazon pages, and Facebook pages establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour Super Naturals brand IBSolution, Premium Probiotic, Sleep Solution, Joint Solution, and Ultra Omega Fish Oil products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safety for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Super Naturals brand IBSolution, Premium Probiotic, Sleep Solution, Joint Solution, and Ultra Omega Fish Oil products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products.
