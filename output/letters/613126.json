Examples of such testimonials include:\n\n• “I developed corona virus working at my job…I got Colloidal Dilver [sic] 1400 ppm, sinus spray 750 ppm, probiotic good bacteria and Daily 108 vitamins.

The symptoms begin to subside” [May 21, 2020 Facebook Post]\n\nGenerally, a drug product is a “new drug” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), unless it is generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling. Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an FDA-approved application, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour Colloidal Silver 1400 ppm Dropper, Colloidal Silver 1400 Spray, Silver 750 Sinus Spray, Silver Eye Drops, Daily 108, Daily Detox, Digest Foods Capsule, Mellow Life, Candida Kit, Cardiovascular Kit, Manuka CBD Silver Spray and Diabetes Kit products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Colloidal Silver 1400 ppm Dropper, Colloidal Silver 1400 Spray, Silver 750 Sinus Spray, Silver Eye Drops, Daily 108, Daily Detox, Digest Foods Capsule, Mellow Life, Candida Kit, Cardiovascular Kit, and Diabetes Kit fail to bear adequate directions for their intended uses and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].\n\nFurther, the Colloidal Silver 1400 ppm Dropper, Colloidal Silver 1400 Spray, Silver 750 Sinus Spray, and Silver Eye Drops products all contain colloidal silver as an active ingredient and are made available for purchase over-the-counter (OTC) without a prescription. Nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application are subject to section 505G of the Act. Specifically, OTC colloidal silver drug products fall under section 505G(a)(5), because the Agency has established, in a final determination issued under 21 CFR part 330, according to that no colloidal silver-containing OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective [21 CFR 310.548]. Further, 21 CFR 310.548 states that any OTC drug product containing colloidal silver ingredients “that is labeled, represented, or promoted for the treatment and/or prevention of any disease is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of [the Act] for which an approved application . . . is required for marketing” and that, in the absence of an approved application, “such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the [A]ct”Act [21 U.S.C. 352].\n\nTo the extent that your colloidal silver products are subject to section 505G, they are also misbranded under section 502(ee) of the Act.\n\nYour Silver Eye Drops product is especially concerning from a public health perspective because ophthalmic drug products can pose serious risk of harm to humans if toxic substances are introduced directly into the eye because irreversible damage, including vision loss, can result.\n\nIn addition, your Silver 750 Sinus Spray product is especially concerning from a public health perspective because intranasal drug products may be rapidly absorbed through the highly vascularized nasal mucosa directly into systemic blood circulation, where they may exert undesirable systemic effects such as increased heart rate or elevated blood pressure. If toxic substances are introduced directly into the nose, harmful local effects such as bleeding, ulceration, or nasal septal perforation may occur.\n\nUnapproved Animal Drug Products\n\nWe note that you also promote your Colloidal Silver 1400 ppm Dropper drugs for animal use. For example, your webpages https://glennburkettwellness.com and https://www.gb1com.com. In the “Suggested Use” section on the label depicted on your product page for your Colloidal Silver 1400 ppm Dropper product contains directions for pets and the front of the label contains an image of a dog and cat. New animal drugs that are not the subject of an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing are unsafe under section 512(a) of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)], and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nConclusion\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\n\nPlease notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\n\nYour written response should be directed to the Food and Drug Administration, attention to: Mr. Ramon Hernández, District Director, 466 Fernández Juncos Avenue, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00901-3223.

Hernandez\nDistrict Director | FDA San Juan District\nProgram Division Director\nOffice of Human and Animal Food Operations\nEast Division IV\n\n____________________________\n\n1 Information on your website and social media account suggests that you may intend to market your Silver 750 Sinus Spray and Silver Eye Drops products as dietary supplements. For example, you display pictures of the labels of these products on your website that include “dietary supplement” on the label. However, these products do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(2)(A)(i)]. The Act defines the term “dietary supplement” in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Your product page for Silver 750 Sinus Spray, includes a statement, “Suggested use: Place applicator in nostril, squeeze container and inhale.” Your product page for Silver Eye Drops includes a statement, “Silver Eye Drops,” and “Supports immune response to infection/dry eyes.” In addition, on your Facebook page, you include a video where you perform a hand gesture of applying your Silver Eye Drops product in the eye (see: https://www.facebook.com/GlennBurkettBeautyFitnessHealth/posts/2094433670606560).\n\n2 There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists (originally issued Jan. 31, 2020, and subsequently renewed), available at https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19. Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), available at https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/. Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.",
