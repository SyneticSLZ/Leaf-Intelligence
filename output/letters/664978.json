Ltd. d/b/a Kangertech\n\nUnited States\n\n james@szkanger.com\n kangerservice@szkanger.com\nIssuing Office:\nCenter for Tobacco Products\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\n\nSeptember 14, 2023\n\n \n\nDear David He and Zhu Xiaochun:\n\nThe Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed the website https://www.kangertech.com, and additional information, and determined that electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products are offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United States.\n\nUnder section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are components or parts of products made or derived from tobacco or containing nicotine from any source, and are intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including ENDS products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)), and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS products containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\n\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\n\nOur review of the website https://www.kangertech.com, and additional information, revealed that Shenzhen Kanger Technology Co. Ltd. d/b/a Kangertech manufactures ENDS products, including those listed below, and delivers the ENDS products without required marketing authorization orders to retailers in the United States that market and sell those products to individuals in the United States. Specifically, Shenzhen Kanger Technology Co. Ltd. d/b/a Kangertech owns and operates the website https://www.kangertech.com, distributes the products without required market authorization to retailers identified on https://www.kangertech.com as retailers that sell the products, and directs consumers to those retailers. Such retailers, which are found in the “Global Sales Network” webpage of https://www.kangertech.com, include LightFire Vapor (https://www.lightfirevapor.com). ENDS products offered for sale or distribution within the United States on https://www.lightfirevapor.com include: Kanger TOP EVOD Kit, Kanger T2 Replacement Coil – 5PK, Kanger SOCC Replacement Coil – 5PK – 2.2OHMS.\n\nThe ENDS products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, these products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products were not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nFDA has determined that your firm delivers new tobacco products lacking premarket authorization for introduction into interstate commerce in the United States. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion.\n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and promptly take any necessary actions to bring the tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act. It is your responsibility to ensure that these tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., and implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory or legal action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\n\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that these products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov.\n\nPlease note your reference number, RW2302013, in your response and direct your response via email at CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov and to the following address:\n\nDPAL-WL Response, Office of Compliance and Enforcement\nFDA Center for Tobacco Products\nc/o Document Control Center\nBuilding 71, Room G335\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nIf you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact Bryan Hills at (301) 796-9367 or via email at CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nAnn Simoneau, J.D.\nDirector\nOffice of Compliance and Enforcement\nCenter for Tobacco Products\n\nVIA UPS and Electronic Mail\n\ncc:\n\nNameBrew LLC\nsupport@namebright.com\n\nAlibaba NOC\nabuse@alibaba-inc.com\n\nKangerTech US LLC\nAttn: John Sccheung and David He\n11555 Medlock Bridge Rd Ste 100\nDuluth, GA 30097\nLaura@szkanger.com\n\nShenzhen KangerTech Technology Co., Ltd.\nAttn: David He\n2730 North Berkeley Lake Rd, NW B-100\nDuluth, GA 30096\nsccheung@szkanger.com\n\nKanger Tech US LLC\nAttn: David He and Zhu Xiaochun\n11455 Lakefield Dr. Unit 100\nDuluth, GA 30097\n\nLightFire Vapor\n10601 State Street, Suite #6\nTamarac, FL 33321\nsales@lightfirevapor.com",
