Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1.\n\nPlease be aware that, effective August 8, 2016, FDA deemed additional products meeting the definition of a tobacco product, except accessories to these newly deemed products, to be subject to regulation under the Act. These products include, but are not limited to, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including e-cigarettes), e-liquids, cigars, and pipe tobacco. See Final Rule, Deeming Tobacco Products To Be Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as Amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act; Restrictions on the Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products and Required Warning Statements for Tobacco Products, 81 Fed. Reg. 28,974 (May 10, 2016), available at https://federalregister.gov/a/2016-10685.\n\nA Tobacco Product Without Required Ingredient Listing Submissions Is Misbranded\n\nFDA has determined that you have not provided an ingredient listing to FDA as required by section 904(a)(1). Section 904(a)(1) requires each tobacco product manufacturer or importer, or agents thereof to provide “a listing of all ingredients, including tobacco, substances, compounds, and additives that are… added by the manufacturer to the tobacco, paper filter, or other part of each tobacco product by brand and by quantity in each brand and sub-brand.”\n\nBecause you have not provided FDA with an ingredient listing, FDA has determined that Berry Splash e-liquid product, which MadTown Vapor LLC manufactures, sells, and/or distributes to customers in the United States, is misbranded under section 903(a)(10)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387d(a)(1) because you failed to comply with requirements prescribed under section 904 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. §387d). The doing of any act with respect to a tobacco product while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product being misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)). In addition, the failure to provide any information required by section 904 is a prohibited act under section 301(q)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(q)(1)(B)).\n\nA Tobacco Product Packaging Without the Required Nicotine Warning Statement Is Misbranded\n\nFDA’s inspection of your establishment revealed that packages for your Berry Splash e-liquid product, which you manufacture, package, sell, offer to sell, distribute, and/or import for sale or distribution into the United States, do not include the nicotine warning statement required by 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(a). Under 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(a), packages for cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and covered tobacco products (other than cigars), such as e-liquid products, must bear the following warning statement:\n\nWARNING: This product contains nicotine. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.\n\nFor cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and covered tobacco products other than cigars, it is unlawful for any person to manufacture, package, sell, offer to sell, distribute, or import for sale or distribution in the United States such product unless such tobacco product package bears the required warning statement on the package label (21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(a)(1)). Under 21 C.F.R. § 1143.1, a “covered tobacco product” is defined as any tobacco product deemed to be subject to the FD&C Act under 21 C.F.R. § 1100.2, excluding components or parts not made or derived from tobacco. The e-liquid product whose packages do not contain the required nicotine warning statement is a “covered tobacco product.” Under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)), tobacco products are misbranded if sold or distributed in violation of regulations prescribed under section 906(d) of the FD&C Act, including those within 21 C.F.R. Part 1143. Because your Berry Splash e-liquid product does not include the required nicotine warning statement on its packages, in violation of 21 C.F.R. § 1143.3(a), it is misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)).\n\nIn addition, a tobacco product is misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Under section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in determining whether labeling and/or advertising is misleading, the agency considers, among other things, the failure to reveal material facts concerning the consequences that may result from the customary or usual use of the product.\n\nBecause the product packages for your Berry Splash e-liquid product do not include the required nicotine warning statement, it is misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)). The doing of any act with respect to a tobacco product while such article is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce which results in such product being misbranded is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(k)).\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the ones stated above and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the types described above may result in FDA’s taking regulatory action. These actions may include but are not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that any adulterated and/or misbranded tobacco products offered for import into the United States are subject to detention and refusal of admission.\n\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your corrective actions, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
