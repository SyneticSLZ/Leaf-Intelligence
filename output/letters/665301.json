Certain tobacco products, including ENDS products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n\nPlease be aware that on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine derived from tobacco.  See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source.  Tobacco products, including ENDS products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations.  For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14. \n\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect.  A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)).  Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\n\nOur review of the website https://vape123.com revealed that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States the following ENDS products without a marketing authorization order, including: Oly Frozen Disposable Device 7000 Puffs – Passion Guava, Vapin’ Donuts – Cup Rechargeable Disposable 7000 Puffs - Mango Lychee, Elfbar Pi9000 Rechargeable Disposable 9000 Puff - Elf Dream, and Esco Bar 2500 Puffs Disposable Device with Mesh Coil - Banana Ice. These products do not have a marketing authorization order.\n\nThese ENDS products are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007.  These products do not have an FDA marketing authorization order in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement.  Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act.  In addition, these products are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act. \n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nFDA finds these products particularly concerning because the product labeling and/or advertising for the Oly Frozen and Vapin’ Donuts products (see Exhibits A) are likely to promote use of the products by youth by imitating beverage containers (see Exhibits B).  Further, the products’ design is likely to promote the use of the products by youth because they help conceal the nature of the product as a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults, and therefore could be openly carried without revealing to parents, teachers, or other adults that the products are tobacco products.  FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of ENDS products.  Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA.  Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with ENDS products.\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions \n\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products lacking premarket authorization in the United States. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion.\n\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and promptly take any necessary actions to bring the tobacco products you offer for sale or distribution in the United States into compliance with the FD&C Act. It is your responsibility to ensure that these tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations.  Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., and implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory or legal action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction.  However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.  Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\n\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.  If you believe that these products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.  This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them.  You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov.\n\nPlease note your reference number, RW2301982, in your response and direct your response via email at CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov and to the following address: \n\nDPAL-WL Response, Office of Compliance and Enforcement \nFDA Center for Tobacco Products\nc/o Document Control Center\nBuilding 71, Room G335\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nIf you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact Bryan Hills at (301) 796-9367 or via email at CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov.    \n\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\nAnn Simoneau, J.D.\nDirector\nOffice of Compliance and Enforcement \nCenter for Tobacco Products\n\n\nVIA Electronic Mail\n\ncc:\n\nGoDaddy.com, LLC\nabuse@godaddy.com \n\nBigCommerce, Inc.\nabuse@cloudflare.com",
