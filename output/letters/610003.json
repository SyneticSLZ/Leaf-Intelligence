This ability may benefit those experiencing chronic inflammation, and its related pain, due to surgery, . . . injuries, etc.”\n    o “Healthy tissues are vulnerable to chronic inflammation and injury caused by foreign tissue growth when enzymes are too low to regulate normal repair processes. This, in turn, may lead to scar tissue and adhesion formation in the surrounding structures. Pain is often the result of these conditions and may be the first sign of a problem such as injury, fibroids, or arthritis. Reducing inflammation with Systemic Enzyme Therapy may be a useful strategy for reducing pain by way of clearing inflammation and halting the inflammatory process.”\n• “2) Regulate the Immune System”\n    o “A balanced and well-functioning immune system ensures protection from viable pathogens while protecting healthy tissues from auto-immune antibodies. Patients who suffer from pain as part of an auto-immune response may experience relief that other treatments have failed to address. The proteolytic activity of systemic enzymes may also provide protection against virus proliferation through their ability to neutralize the defense shield of the virus, thereby preventing the virus from attaching to healthy DNA. Systemic enzymes are non-toxic and without side effects, making them a great alternative to traditional pain medications.”\n• “3) Remove Excess Fibrin”\n    o “A primary role of systemic enzymes is to dissolve and digest non-living tissue – scars, excess fibrin which may be found in fibrous cysts in the reproductive system, and blood clots . . .”\n    o “Systemic Enzyme Therapy . . . [b]reaks down the rogue or ‘extra-large’ proteins circulating in the blood that can lead to pain, inflammation, and infection”\n    o “After previous scar and other necrotic tissues have been eliminated, enzymes continue to keep the inflammatory response in balance so that further excess fibrin does not build up again.”\n• “4) Restore Blood Flow”\n    o “[E]nzymes clear unhealthy build-up in the circulatory system (plaque) similar to the way they ‘eat up’ excess fibrin in other systems.”\n    o “Systemic enzymes also improve circulation by increasing the flexibility of red blood cells, defending against the accumulation of platelets, and preventing abnormal blood clotting.”\n    o “Stagnant, sticky blood also plays a role in the imbalances known as endometriosis, PCOS, . . . , ovarian cysts, and uterine fibroids.”\n\nWORLDNUTRITION.NET - Articles\n• The Role of Proteolytic Enzymes [which include protease, peptidase, bromelain, papain, and nattokinase, ingredients in Vitälzȳm Extra Strength, Vitälzȳm Systemic and Digestive Formula (Vitalzym Original Hybrid Formula), Vitälzȳm Cardio, Vitälzȳm Digest, Vitälzȳm Xe, and Nättovīta™], in Treating and Preventing Vascular and Cardiovascular Conditions, May 20, 2020\n    o “Coronary heart disease is caused by a blockage or narrowing of the arteries that supply blood directly to the heart and can lead to a heart attack or angina. Angina is not strictly a heart condition itself but is discomfort or pain felt in the chest, jaw, stomach, neck, or arm as a result of a restricted supply of blood to the heart. A heart attack is the result of a complete blockage of blood supply to part of the heart, usually caused by a clot forming within one of the heart’s arteries. A heart attack usually causes irreparable damage to at least one part of the heart.”\n    o “Nattokinase targets the molecule’s fibrin, which is derived from fibrinogen, and whose role is to assist the clotting process by coagulating blood. Due to the aging process. . . chronic inflammation . . . blood flow problems and increased risk of clotting can occur. Nattokinase is the proteolytic enzyme best placed to ensure proper blood coagulation.”\n    o “Proteases - An enzyme preparation designed to treat vascular and cardiovascular conditions should contain appropriate levels of proteases to provide enzyme support.”\n\n• Fighting Viruses with Proteolytic Enzymes [which include protease, peptidase, bromelain, papain, and nattokinase, ingredients in Vitälzȳm Extra Strength, Vitälzȳm Systemic and Digestive Formula (Vitalzym Original Hybrid Formula), Vitälzȳm Cardio, Vitälzȳm Digest, Vitälzȳm Xe, and Nättovīta™], March 23, 2020\n    o “Viruses can enter the human body in different ways, but most commonly (and particularly regarding the Coronavirus) by tiny droplets entering the body through the eyes, nose, or mouth. . . . While most of the world is focused on the coronavirus right now, other well-known viruses include encephalitis, chickenpox, herpes, measles, and the stealth virus. . . . Virus cells have an outer layer made of a protein called the capsid . . . Fortunately, proteolytic enzymes can destroy this protective coating, making the virus easier to destroy.”\n    o “Fibrin plays a helpful role when it comes to viruses: bacteria and virus cells can hide beneath a healthy blood vessel’s outer fibrin layer – making it much harder for your body’s natural defense system to find and destroy these hiding virus cells. Proteolytic enzymes have the benefit of breaking down excess fibrin, giving virus cells nowhere to hide and making it much easier for your body’s defense system to kick in and destroy the virus.”\n    o “One of the best-known applications of proteolytic enzymes is to bolster the human body’s overall immune system. A strong immune system will not only help the body fight off existing viruses and infections, but it can also even prevent future outbreaks from occurring at all.”\n    o “Research and case studies show promising results for the use of proteolytic enzymes to fight viruses like the Coronavirus.”\n\n• Autoimmune Disease and Nutrition, March 9, 2020\n    o “The following conditions are examples of some of the autoimmune diseases individuals manage every day:\nCeliac disease\nInflammatory bowel diseases\nLupus (SLE)\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA)\nPsoriasis”\n    o “Systemic enzymes [systemic enzymes highlighted among ingredients on product pages for Vitälzȳm Extra Strength, Vitälzȳm Systemic and Digestive Formula (Vitalzym Original Hybrid Formula), Vitälzȳm Cardio, and Vitälzȳm Xe] are naturally occurring and promote overall health, throughout your entire body. While these occur naturally, bodies decrease production over time. Without this support, the body may have difficulty fighting infections, repairing tissue that is injured, and fighting off disease. Supplements may help.”\n\n• Treating Multiple Sclerosis with Proteolytic Enzymes [which include protease, peptidase, bromelain, papain, and nattokinase, ingredients in Vitälzȳm Extra Strength, Vitälzȳm Systemic and Digestive Formula (Vitalzym Original Hybrid Formula), Vitälzȳm Cardio, Vitälzȳm Digest, Vitälzȳm Xe, and Nättovīta™], February 4, 2020\n    o “With no known cure and primary characterization of the progressive worsening of symptoms, multiple sclerosis has proved to be one of the hardest diseases to treat. However, patients with MS can draw hope from generally underpublicized research and clinical trials that have shown remarkable improvement in symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis with the use of proteolytic enzymes.”\n    o “Most remarkably, scientists and physicians who have been administering proteolytic enzyme treatment to MS patients – often in controlled studies – have seen first-hand how proteolytic enzymes can not only halt the progression of the patient’s disease but alleviate or even dissipate certain symptoms altogether.”\n    o “The anti-inflammatory nature of proteolytic enzymes can affect all immune complexes, not just myelin. By reducing inflammation in internal organs, blood vessels, tendons, muscles, and the skin and eyes, MS patients can find relief from other symptomatic elements of the disease.”\n\n• 5 Easy Ways to Regulate High Blood Pressure, December 18, 2019\n    o “If you suffer from high blood pressure, finding ways to regulate it is a must for your overall health and well-being.”\n    o “Add a systemic enzyme supplement to your daily wellness routine: From healing excess scar tissue to reducing inflammation, systemic enzyme supplements can provide the body with a variety of wellness benefits–including blood pressure regulation. These supplements, especially those that contain serrapeptase [an ingredient in Vitälzȳm Xe] as a key ingredient, work well for improving blood flow circulation. Systemic enzymes [systemic enzymes highlighted among ingredients on product pages for Vitälzȳm Extra Strength, Vitälzȳm Systemic and Digestive Formula (Vitalzym Original Hybrid Formula), Vitälzȳm Cardio, and Vitälzȳm Xe] break down plaque and other debris that may be blocking the flow of blood.

New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug based on scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.\n\nA drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.\n\nYour Vitälzȳm Extra Strength, Vitälzȳm Systemic and Digestive Formula (Vitalzym Original Hybrid Formula), Vitälzȳm Cardio, Vitälzȳm Digest, Vitälzȳm Xe, Nättovīta™, Ketsumeisei™, Probiotic 10/50 by Vitälzȳm, and PuraCell™ products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use these products safely for the intended purposes. Accordingly, Vitälzȳm Extra Strength, Vitälzȳm Systemic and Digestive Formula (Vitalzym Original Hybrid Formula), Vitälzȳm Cardio, Vitälzȳm Digest, Vitälzȳm Xe, Nättovīta™, Ketsumeisei™, Probiotic 10/50 by Vitälzȳm, and PuraCell™ fail to bear adequate directions for their intended uses and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].\n\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products.
