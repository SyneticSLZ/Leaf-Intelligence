Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nThis inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. We received a response(s) from Lorraine Hanley, VP Global Quality and Regulatory Affairs dated March 8, 2022, along with three updated responses dated April 11, 2022, May 11, 2022, and June 13, 2022, concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, that was issued to your firm. We address this response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to adequately establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a). Specifically,\n\nYour firm’s procedure, 006-SOP Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) Rev K, effective 1/15/19, includes a section (7.1.2) which states: “appropriate statistical methodology shall be employed when necessary to detect recurring quality problems.” The Director of Regulatory Affairs and Design Assurance stated the procedure should have included a statement that any product-related complaint which is reported (b)(4) over a 12-month rolling period will automatically trigger a CAPA Request and that your firm uses this threshold for initiating a CAPA request. He stated there was no statistical rationale for the threshold of 10 complaints but explained that this threshold was selected after a review of your baseline complaint numbers. Your firm did not follow this procedure of CAPA initiation for the following:\n\nApproximately 64 complaints reporting flow rate issues in a twelve-month period (September 1, 2020 through August 31, 2021)\nApproximately 13 complaints reporting the air-in-line sensor does not alarm in a twelve-month period (November 1, 2020 through October 31, 2021)\nApproximately 22 complaints related to battery-related issues, including 10 complaints reporting the Z-800 series Infusion Pumps do not hold their charge in a seven-month period (May 1, 2021 through November 31, 2021)\n\nThe adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time. We acknowledge your commitments to perform several action items in your March 8, 2022 response related to remediation of this violation including revisions to CAPA related procedures & forms, issuance of new CAPAs for battery-related, power-related, and flow rate issues, performing a retrospective review of CAPAs, and complaint trending to determine the need for additional CAPAs revisions. We also acknowledge that you supplied additional responses dated April 11, 2022, May 11, 2022, and June 13, 2022. However, none of your promised actions have been completed and anticipated timeframes for the conduction and completion of your promised actions were not provided. In your response, explain how the firm’s current criteria for receiving ten or more product-related complaints within a twelve-month period is an appropriate statistical methodology. Additionally, provide a timeframe for the activities promised as well as the results of activities as they become available.\n\n2. Failure to adequately establish and maintain procedures for the identification, documentation, validation or where appropriate verification, review, and approval of design changes before their implementation, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(i). Specifically:\n\nYour firm’s design control procedure (Document # 001-SOP; Rev. K; effective 1/18/19) includes a section (7) which states that for design changes, “verification and validation activities shall be carried out to determine whether a change could significantly affect safety and effectiveness of the device.” Your firm did not perform adequate verification and validation activities for the following changes made to three of your firm’s Administration Sets (b)(4): change in sterilization method (b)(4). For example:\n\nYour firm waived verification testing for these design changes to the administration sets tubing stating that the (b)(4) Administration sets were identical to a previous series (B2) of administration sets which had proven durable ((b)(4); dated 6/21/19). These sets were not identical as noted in your firm’s engineering change order for this tubing change, as documented in Engineering Change Request Form (ECR# 2019-ECR-004; dated 3/27/19) where you list several material changes for compatibility with gamma irradiation.\nYour firm changed and approved the sterilization method from ethylene oxide to gamma radiation through Engineering Change Request 2019-ECR-004; dated 03/27/19. Your firm also changed several components and materials on your infusion sets without appropriate review of devices using the new sterilization method prior to approval of the change.\nYour firm did not perform adequate validation of user needs for (b)(4) administration sets in accordance with your Usability Engineering SOP (#035-SOP; Rev. C; dated 3/9/18) in which section 6.5.3 lists a required sample size of 15 users for human factors simulation testing. The SOP in Appendix A also notes that usability studies should include test participant feedback regarding “device use, critical tasks, use errors, and problems.” However, both your Usability Validation Plan for (b)(4) Administration Set Series (Document# (b)(4); dated 8/9/19) and Usability Assessment for (b)(4) Administration Set Series (Document# (b)(4); dated 8/26/19) only lists 10 users, and not 15 as required in your SOP. Further, your Usability Assessment in Appendix B of Section 10 and Section 11 only includes minimal feedback on usability of the subject device.\n\nThe adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time. We acknowledge your commitments to perform several action items in your March 8, 2022 response related to remediation of this violation including revisions to your design control system and conducting durability testing, shelf-life studies, and packaging validation. We also acknowledge that you supplied additional responses dated April 11, 2022, May 11, 2022, and June 13, 2022. However, none of your promised actions have been completed and anticipated timeframes for the conduction and completion of your promised actions were not provided. In your response, provide a timeframe for the activities promised as well as the results of activities as they become available.\n\n3. Failure to adequately review, evaluate, and investigate any complaint involving the possible failure of a device to meet any of its specifications, unless such investigation has already been performed and another investigation is not necessary, as required by 21 CFR § 820.198(c).\nSpecifically,\n\nThree (3) of the 30 complaint records reviewed involved the possible failure of the device to meet specifications and no failure investigation was performed.\n\nFor example:\n\nComplaint #2021v-004, dated 01/18/21, alleging white markings on the outside of the pigtail of administration set model BG-70071-D-TP, lot number: 200077111. The complaint record stated that samples will be sent from this lot by complainant. However in the investigation/conclusion section of the complaint record it states: “The affected device was not returned. Therefore, no investigation could be performed and no cause could be established”. No additional investigation was conducted and no other information is provided in the record that references another investigation performed for a similar complaint.\nComplaint #2021v-007, dated 2/22/21, alleging that administration set model B2-70071-DF, lot number 20085018 “was leaking at the filter closest to the patient” on two separate occasions. The record then states that the “the sets that had the leaks were discarded and will not be returned” and that the complainant “had ten sets left in the box” which were going to be sent for testing. However in the investigation/conclusion section of the complaint record it states: “The affected device was not returned. Therefore, no investigation could be performed and no cause could be established”. No additional investigation was conducted and no other information is provided in the record that references another investigation performed for a similar complaint.\nComplaint #2021v-015, dated 04/13/21, alleging “an administration set model BG-70071-DF-TP 20086809 tube was leaking near the drip chamber.” A MDR was sent for this complaint (MDR No.: 3006575795-2021-00023). However, the investigation section of the complaint record states: “Set will not be returned because of the drug in the tubing.” No additional investigation was conducted and no other information is provided in the record that references another investigation performed for a similar complaint.\n\nIn each of these complaint records, it is noted that the device will be returned for evaluation but your reason for not performing an investigation states that the device was not returned. No further details regarding similar investigations, additional attempts to have the device returned, or further communication with the complainant are included in the complaint record.\n\nThe adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time. We acknowledge your commitments to perform several action items in your March 8, 2022 response related to remediation of this violation including revisions to your complaint system to include procedures, work instructions, tools and templates, remediation of complaint files having incomplete or no investigations, and a retrospective review of complaints. We also acknowledge that you supplied additional responses dated April 11, 2022, May 11, 2022, and June 13, 2022. However, none of your promised actions have been completed and anticipated timeframes for the conduction and completion of your promised actions were not provided. In your response, provide a timeframe for the activities promised as well as the results of activities as they become available.\n\nOur inspection also revealed that your firm’s administration sets are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 - Medical Device Reporting. Significant violations include the following:\n\nFailure to submit a report to FDA no later than 30 calendar days after the day that your firm received or otherwise became aware of information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that a device that your firm markets has malfunctioned and this device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur, as required by 21 CFR 803.50(a)(2). For example, the information included for Complaint 2021v-005 references a malfunction (i.e., leakage) of each of three of your firm’s Administration Sets while in use. Your firm became aware of three separate events on January 18, 2021. Although your firm submitted an MDR #3006575795-2021-00002 on January 29, 2021, it included information about three separate device malfunction events. Your firm failed to submit a malfunction MDR to FDA for each of the three individual MDR Reportable events referenced in the above complaint.\n\nThe adequacy of your firm’s response dated March 8, 2022, cannot be determined at this time. Your firm noted in its response that it will submit two additional MDRs to account for each of the three reportable events referenced in Complaint 2021v-005. Your firm also noted that it will take systemic corrective actions, including a retrospective review of adverse events received from May 2019 to January 2022. However, it failed to indicate whether it is submitting a supplemental report to MDR #3006575795-2021-00002 to clarify that it is submitting two additional individual malfunction MDRs to account for each event referenced in the subject MDR. When submitting a supplemental report your firm should cross reference the MDR numbers of each of the two additional individual reports it submits for the events referenced in the initial MDR #3006575795-2021-00002. Also, your firm did not provide documentation or evidence of the systemic corrective actions as they are still presently ongoing.\n\nYour firm’s responses dated April 11, 2022, May 11, 2022, and June 13, 2022 do not address this issue.\n\nAdditionally, our inspection revealed that your administration sets are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. §360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). The administration sets are also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the device into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k).\n\nFor example, your firm made the following modifications to your administration sets that require the submission of a new 510(k):\n\nChange in sterilization method from (b)(4). While the change in sterilization method was cleared under K132841, your firm changed several components and materials on your infusion sets. Changes in sterilization methods may affect material biocompatibility and performance, which may also impact product shelf life.\nReplacement of the spike with (b)(4) and changes to several materials, including the drip chamber, back-check valve, slide clamp, filter and a portion of the tubing between the (b)(4) and drip chamber. According to your records, these changes were implemented to address new market needs.\n\nFor a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. 21 CFR 807.81(b) The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the device is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed.\n\nThis letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the circumstances above. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties.\n\nOther federal agencies may take your compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations into account when considering the award of federal contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been addressed. Should FDA determine that your devices or facilities do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to address the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address any violations included in this Warning Letter. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration as part of your response.\n\nYour firm’s response should be sent to: Gina Brackett, Director of Compliance Branch, at oradevices1firmresponse@fda.hhs.gov. Refer to CMS #629844 when replying. If you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Sean Moynihan at 410-779-5134 or sean.moynihan@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of any violations and take prompt actions to address any violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nCourtney H.
