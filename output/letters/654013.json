Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are accessories intended to be used with endoscopes for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body.\n\nThis inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\n\nWe received responses from Mr. Seiji Morishita, Director of Olympus Medical Systems Corp, Hinode dated December 5, 2022, January 10, 2023, and February 13, 2023, concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, which was issued to your firm. We address this response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to adequately establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action, including analyzing processes, work operations, concessions, quality audit reports, quality records, service records, complaints, returned product, and other sources of quality data to identify existing and potential causes of nonconforming product, or other quality problems, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(1). For example:\n\nA. Since November 2020, Olympus Medical has received approximately 160 complaints describing the “distal end cover” model number MAJ-2315 has “dropped out.” Your firm performed trending and identified that number of complaints was above the expected numbers for that type of complaint. However, your firm did not consider this increasing trend of complaints to be a quality data input to initiate a corrective and preventive action.\n\nB. The process flow diagram of Procedure for Complaint Handling/OMBS (b)(4) describes that complaint investigations that would require evaluation for reportability would not be considered for Corrective and Preventive Action. Complaints are specifically required to be analyzed for inclusion into the CAPA subsystem and complaints that are deemed reportable are of the highest risk complaints and therefore especially important to be considered for corrective and preventive action implementation.\n\nC. Non-Conformances (b)(4) and (b)(4) were opened for observed wrinkles in the package seal of Distal End Cap/MAJ-2315 between October 13 to October 23, 2022. Your firm stated that yield control may be appropriate for some low risk nonconformances instead of using its Nonconforming Product procedure. Yield control allows for an acceptable level of package seal defects, even though there is no assurance that visually observed seal defects would not compromise the sterile barrier. Package sealing is a validated process, which results cannot be verified when the validated requirements of the seal are not met. A potential breach of sterility in the packaging seal would not be considered a low risk nonconformance. Because yield control was inappropriately applied to the package seal defect, the nonconformances were not considered as nonconforming product and not included as quality data for the corrective and preventive actions.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s responses and concluded that they are not adequate. Your firm initiated CAPA-200735 to investigate complaints of MAJ-2315 “dropped out” and after conducting a Health Hazard Analysis (HHA), concluded that no additional action is required and they will continue to monitor complaints for the distal cap falling off in the patient. However, FDA does not agree that the risk to the patient is of a low enough risk to not warrant further action at this time. The HHA conducted does not discuss how/why the risk to the patient is not increased by exposure to the uncovered endoscope during the procedure as it is removed. The HHA does not consider the risk of tissue injury from navigating the gastrointestinal tract with an uncovered scope tip. Further, your firm’s documentation concludes that the distal cap is unlikely to fall off if the user has applied it correctly. CAPA-200735 does not consider whether the device actually meets user needs as required by 21 CFR 820.30(g), including the ability to recognize imperfections in the cap and attach it to the scope correctly without damaging it. While your firm did initiate a systemic corrective and preventive action to determine why this complaint trend was not escalated to a CAPA, the investigation into the issue itself, the cap falling off the scope in the patient, appears to be inadequate.\n\n2. Failure to ensure that when changes or process deviations occur, the manufacturer shall review and evaluate the process and perform revalidation where appropriate, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(c). For example, Nonconformance (b)(4) was opened due to wrinkles and air bubbles in the package seal of MAJ-210/Lot H2410 a sterile product. Your firm made a modification to the manufacturing equipment to increase the cooling rate of the package after sealing. While some testing was performed to demonstrate seal integrity, no re-validation of the process was made. Because sterility of the product is a critical requirement and the process cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test, the process must be validated and re-validated when a modification such as this is made.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s responses and concluded that they are not adequate. Your firm identified its plan to perform revalidation for MAJ-201 sealing operation by January 31, 2023. Also, your firm stated that it will revise (b)(4), Process Validation and (b)(4), Conduct of Process Validation by February 23, 2023, to clarify when revalidation is necessary and to specify who is necessary to review and approve changes to ensure revalidation decisions are appropriately made; and revise (b)(4) Assembly/Processing Equipment Control by February 28, 2023, to ensure that the change control process is followed when process or equipment changes are made.\n\nYour firm reviewed complaints and MDRs from the last two years associated with all products distributed to the US to determine if any signals exist to suggest sterility was compromised as a result of the modification made to the sealing process. It is not clear whether your firm evaluated devices shipped to other markets as well that would have the same concern or could possibly be imported into the US by a third party. Your firm should clarify this. Your firm performed a retrospective review of all changes for all products marketed in the US since each product’s last full validation to determine if any other changes have been made to any products marketed in the US that should have prompted a full or partial revalidation and opened several nonconformances for changes without adequate documentation of necessity for revalidation to investigate impact to product and revalidation requirements. Your firm completed its revalidation of MAJ-210 sealing process on January 31, 2023. Your firm has additional corrective actions planned, including revising its Process Validation procedures to clarify when revalidation is necessary and to specify who is necessary to review and approve changes to ensure revalidation decisions are appropriately made. Your firm also plans to implement a change to its Assembly/Processing Equipment Control procedure to ensure that the change control process is followed when process or equipment changes are made. However, your firm did not mention a plan to train its personnel on these new procedures, nor did it clarify that the retrospective reviews that were done were in line with the new requirements of its procedures. Your firm should provide clarification to these two points and provide documentation of implementation.\n\n3. Failure to adequately establish and maintain procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit, as required by 21 CFR 820.198.\n\nFor example, Complaint (b)(4) was received by Olympus Medical on November 21, 2020. The complaint described that \"a patient sustained esophageal trauma\" and \"tissue from the esophagus was caught up in the distal tip of the device.\" The complaint also stated that the \"customer attributes these events to cracked caps\" and that they noticed a \"few already cracked when coming out of the packaging.\" Your firm’s complaint handling procedure, OMBS (b)(4) requires investigations of complaints to be made within 30 days. The investigation of the complaint was not made until 2022.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s responses and concluded that they are not adequate. Your firm initiated CAPA-200739 to determine the root cause of Observation 4a of the FDA-483. It appears your firm identified the root cause to be related to be a lack of linkage between the scopes and the caps within their system. Your firm completed a retrospective review of all complaints associated with MAJ-2315, expanding the search to other scopes that use the distal cap in addition to TJF-Q190V. Your firm found that there were 98 complaints not initiated according to their procedure during this retrospective review. Your firm stated that it will conduct the necessary investigation and submit MDRs as needed by February 28, 2023.\n\nYour firm revised (b)(4) Complaint Handling, which included instructions for ensuring individual complaints are opened for all related/concomitant devices. Your firm revised (b)(4) Complaint Investigation Work Instruction, which included detailed instruction for ensuring individual complaints are opened for all related/concomitant devices while performing complaint investigation. Your firm confirmed in its plan that personnel have been trained on the new procedures.\n\nYour firm plans to do a retrospective review of complaint records in the past two years related to the issue of cracked caps coming out of the packaging by February 28, 2023.\n\nHowever, it is not clear based on your firm’s CAPA and documentation whether they have investigated why the investigation into the complaint did not occur for two years, while your firm’s procedure requires it to be made within 30 days.\n\nOur inspection also revealed that your firm’s Single-Use Distal Cover (MAJ-2315) devices are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 - Medical Device Reporting. Significant violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to adequately develop, maintain, and implement written MDR procedures as required by 21 CFR 803.17(a).\n\nFor example, during the inspection, your firm identified the document titled “Medical Device Reporting Work Instruction”, OMBS (b)(4), dated 10/26/2022, as its MDR procedure. After reviewing the procedure, the following deficiencies were noted:\n\nA. The procedure does not establish internal systems that provide for timely and effective identification, communication, and evaluation of events that may be subject to MDR requirements, as required by 21 CFR 803.17(a)(1). For example, the procedure includes definitions from 21 CFR 803.3 for the terms “become aware”, “malfunction”, “MDR reportable event”, and the definition of the term “reasonably suggest” found in 803.20(c)(1). However, the procedure omits definitions of the terms “caused or contributed” and “serious injury” from the 21 CFR Part 803.3. The exclusion of the definitions for those terms from the procedure may lead your firm to make an incorrect reportability decision when evaluating a complaint that may meet the criteria for reporting under 21 CFR 803.50(a).\n\nB. The procedure does not establish internal systems that provide for a standardized review process to determine when an event meets the criteria for reporting under this part, as required by 21 CFR 803.17(a)(2).\n\na. For example, there are no instructions for conducting an investigation of each MDR reportable event and evaluating the cause of the event.\nb. The MDR Decision Tree in your firm’s MDR procedure does not reference a process for investigating events identified as MDRs to ensure that MDRs are submitted to FDA within the required reporting timeframes, as required under 21 CFR 803.17(a)(1).\n\nC. The procedure does not establish internal systems that provide for timely transmission of complete medical device reports, as required by 21 CFR 803.17(a)(3). Specifically, the procedure does not include:\n\na. Instructions for how to obtain and complete the FDA 3500A form.\nb. A process for submitting initial and supplement or follow-up reports to FDA in an electronic format that FDA can process, review, and archive in accordance with 21 CFR 803.12(a).\nc. How your firm will ensure that all information reasonably known to you is submitted for each event. Specifically, which sections of the Form 3500A will need to be completed to include all information found in your firm’s possession and any information that becomes available as a result of a reasonable follow-up within the firm.\n\nYour firm’s response did not address the procedural deficiencies noted above, as they were not identified in the FDA-483.\n\n2. Failure to submit a report to FDA no later than 30 calendar days after the day that your firm received or otherwise became aware of information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that a device that your firm markets has malfunctioned and this device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur, as required by 21 CFR 803.50(a)(2).\n\nFor example, the information included for Complaints (b)(4) and (b)(4) reasonably suggests your firm’s duodenovideoscope with a distal cover MAJ-2315 malfunctioned (e.g., cracked cap) while in use, leading to potential mucosal tissue damage. Your firm initiated recall Z-1292-2021 for the referenced malfunction. Per the Preamble, in Medical Devices; Medical User Facility and Manufacturer Reporting, Certification and Registration; Final Rule, 60 Fed. Reg. 63585 (December 11, 1995), Comment 12, a malfunction is reportable if the manufacturer takes or would be required to take an action under sections 518 or 519(g) of the act as a result of the malfunction of the device or other similar devices. There is no information included for the complaints that rules out that the referenced device malfunction would not be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Although your firm submitted the MDRs (MDR# 8010047-2021-03794, 8010047-2022-02861, 8010047-2021-03786, 8010047-2022-02867, 8010047-2021-03796, 8010047-2022-02865) corresponding to each of the referenced events, the MDRs were not received by FDA within the required 30 calendar day timeframe.\n\nThe adequacy of your firm’s responses cannot be determined at this time. Your firm initiated a series of CAPAs to investigate the root cause of the cracked cap problem and have plans to address it accordingly. However, your firm has not provided documentation or evidence that the systemic corrective actions have been fully implemented, including a retrospective review for reportability, as these actions are still ongoing.\n\nYour firm is in the process of completing CAPAs to address the referenced malfunction and updating the complaint handling process. Additionally, your firm conducted a retrospective review of all complaints associated with MAJ-2315 and complaints for the endoscopes (TJF-Q190V, TJF-Q290V, TJF-Q170V), which are used in conjunction with MAJ-2315. As a result, 98 complaints were identified for further investigation and your firm is evaluating them for reportability. However, your firm has not provided documentation or evidence that the systemic corrective actions have been fully implemented, including a retrospective review for reportability, as these actions are still ongoing.\n\nYour firm completed the update of its complaint handling procedures and is evaluating newly identified events related to cracked caps for reportability. However, your firm has not provided documentation or evidence that the systemic corrective actions have been fully implemented, including the submission of newly identified reportable events, as these actions are still ongoing.\n\nOther federal agencies may take your compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementation regulations into account when considering the award of federal contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been addressed.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to address the noted violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective action (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Please provide a translation of documentation not in English to facilitate our review.\n\nWe will notify you regarding the adequacy of your firm’s response(s) and the need to re-inspect your firm’s facility to verify that the appropriate corrections and/or corrective actions have been made. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration as part of your response.\n\nYour firm’s response should be sent via email to CDRHWarningLetterResponses@fda.hhs.gov or by mail to Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Office of Regulatory Programs, Division of Regulatory Programs 2, FDA Regulatory Inspections and Audits Team, White Oak Building 66, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993. Refer to CMS case #654013 when replying. If you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Shanil Haugen, Ph.D., at Shanil.Haugen@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of any violations and take prompt actions to address any violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n/S/\n\nCourtney H.
