Jupiter\n? Vega\n? Neptune\n? Luna\n? Cosmo\n? Nova\n? Galaxa\n\nUnder section 201(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nA review of our records reveals that you have not obtained marketing approval or clearance before you began offering your product for sale, which is a violation of the law. FDA has reviewed your firm’s website www.spacetouch.com on February 2, 2021 and determined that the devices listed above are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g) for the device as described and marketed. The devices listed above are also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the device into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k).\n\nOur review of your firm’s website at www.spacetouch.com determined your firm is making intended use claims which cause the products to be medical devices under section 201(h) of the Act. These claims include, but are not limited to:\n\nJupiter:\n\no “WHAT JUPITER TARGETS: WRINKLES & LINES | … | PIGMENTATION | ACNE | . . . .”\no “The Blue Light technology is used to treat sun damage and to prevent skin cancer growth.

It’s clinically certified as safe on all parts of the body and treats a variety of skin issues including cellulite, spider veins, discoloration, acne, scars, and sagging skin.”\n\nPlease note this is not an exhaustive list. We also note that some of these indications of treating serious life-threatening diseases, such as cancers, dysplasia, hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice, osteoporosis, heart disease, kidney and digestive tract diseases, emaciation and anemia, etc., have not been verified with any clinical data in an FDA marketing application of this device type. These claims could mislead patients and result in the delay or substitution of critical medical treatment, thereby posing further health risks.\n\nOn June 17, 2020, we sent you an “It Has Come to Our Attention” letter, requesting that you provide the FDA with either clearance or approval submission number(s) for the devices listed above. We have reviewed your firm’s response, dated July 23, 2020, and determined it is not adequate. Your firm’s response states that: “We currently manufacture our devices in China. Factory name: Zhongshan Bisen Plastic Electronic products co. LTD.” You also provided the substantial equivalence determination letter for K162489, for RED Light Device by Zhongshan Bisen Plastic Electronic Products Co., Ltd. However, we have reviewed our records and determined that the FDA cleared RED Light Device is not related to any of the devices being marketed by Marci Beauty LLC on www.spacetouch.com. Moreover, the RED Light Device was cleared under K162489 with the following indications: “The RED Light Device is an OTC device indicated to emit energy in the red and IR region of the spectrum for use in dermatology for the treatment of periorbital wrinkles.” However, the devices marketed by your firm have various indications and device designs that are different from and outside the scope of the clearance for the RED Light Device. Your firm’s products, as described above, meet the definition of a device as defined in section 201(h) of the Act and are subject to all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.\n\nTherefore, the devices listed above are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). The devices are also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the devices into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. 21 CFR 807.81(b). The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the device is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed.\n\nOur office requests that Marci Beauty LLC cease any activities that result in the misbranding or adulteration of the devices listed above, such as the commercial distribution of the devices for the uses discussed above.\n\nYour firm should take prompt action to address any violations described in this letter. Failure to adequately address this matter may lead to regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Also, other federal agencies may take your compliance history into account when considering the award of contracts.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to address any violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address any violations included in this Warning Letter. Please provide a translation of documentation not in English to facilitate our review.\n\nYour firm’s response should be sent to:\n\nFood and Drug Administration\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health\nOffice of Regulatory Programs\nDivision of Regulatory Programs 2: Establishment Support\nRegulatory Inspections and Audits Team\nWhite Oak Building 66\n10903 New Hampshire Ave.\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\n\nRefer to the identification number CMS# 612041 when replying. We remind you that only written communication is considered as official. If you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Purva Pandya at 240-402-9979.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA.\n\nSincerely yours,\n/S/\n\nBinita S.
