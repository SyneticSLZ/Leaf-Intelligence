Tran\nOwner\nVictory Trading Company Inc.\n\n1634 Greenland Road\nGreenland, NH 03840-2247\nUnited States\n\nIssuing Office:\nDivision of Human and Animal Food Operations East I\n\nUnited States\n\nWARNING LETTER\nCMS # 651799\n\nDear Mr. Tran:\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your ambient, refrigerated, and frozen food warehouse located at 1634 Greenland Road, Greenland, NH 03840, from December 12, 2022 to January 13, 2023. During our inspection, FDA investigators found serious violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117). At the conclusion of the inspection, FDA issued an FDA Form-483 (FDA-483), Inspectional Observations, listing deviations found during our inspection. In addition, during the inspection, FDA collected filth samples from various areas within your warehouse facility, and the analytical results revealed rodent filth present throughout your facility.\n\nBased on inspectional and analytical findings, we determined the food products held in your facility are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health.\n\nYou may find the Act and further information relating to the CGMP & PC rule and your responsibilities to comply with this and other FDA regulations through links on FDA’s web page at https://www.fda.gov.\n\nYour firm voluntarily destroyed the (b)(4) pallets of rice that were (b)(7)(A); however, to date, we have not received your written response to the issued FDA-483 describing corrective actions taken or planned by your firm to correct the identified deficiencies. Based on our review of the inspectional and analytical findings, we are issuing this letter to advise you of FDA’s continuing concerns and to provide detailed information describing the findings at your facility.\nWe found the following significant violations:\n\nCurrent Good Manufacturing Practice (21 CFR Part 117, Subpart B)\n\n1. You did not take effective measures to exclude pests from your holding areas and to protect against the contamination of food on the premises by pests, as required by 21 CFR 117.35(c). Specifically, rodent activity was observed throughout your warehouse facility including the following:\n\nRodent Activity observed\n\n(b)(4)\n\nOn December 12, 2022, during a bag-by-bag examination of (b)(4) pallets of (b)(4) White Rice, lot # “(b)(4)”, stored in the (b)(4) corner of your warehouse, apparent rodent excreta pellets (REPs) too numerous to count (TNTC), apparent rodent gnaw holes in the bags of rice, and yellow stains on the bags of rice which smelled like urine and fluoresced UV light.

You did not maintain your plant in a clean and sanitary condition and keep your plant in repair adequate to prevent food from becoming adulterated, as required by 21 CFR 117.35(a). Specifically, insanitary conditions were observed throughout your facility demonstrating that sanitation, cleaning, and maintenance operations were inadequate. The following observations reflect potential areas for pest harborage and attractants for pests:\n\n(b)(4)\n\nOn December 13, 2022, a 24\" x 8\" rip in the insulation liner of the (b)(4) wall exposing insulation. The exposed insulation had been partially removed and apparent REPs TNTC were observed inside the insulation.\nOn December 13, 2022, an approximate 1/4\" hole through the wall to the outside and an approximate 12\" x 12\" rip in the insulation liner of the (b)(4) wall. An empty beer bottle was observed in the hole.\nOn December 15, 2022, an approximate 2-3” gap along the entire length of the (b)(4) wall creating a potential ingress for pests.\nOn December 15, 2022, an approximate 1” wide crack in the floor approximately 12” from pallet location (b)(4) creating a potential ingress for pests near the (b)(4) wall in the warehouse.\nOn December 15, 2022, an approximate ½” gap in the floor approximately 6” from pallet location (b)(4) in the (b)(4) area of the warehouse.

The area below the gap appeared to be hollow.\nOn December 13, 2022, two approximate 1” gaps around electrical conduits in the (b)(4) wall of the warehouse creating an opening to the outside.\n\n(b)(4)\n\nOn December 12, 2022, the plastic liner of the dividing wall in the center of the warehouse in the (b)(4) side contained what appeared to be rodent gnaw holes and apparent REPs inside the insulation in the wall. Apparent rodent nesting materials were observed on the ground, and gnaw marks were observed on a wooden post of the dividing wall.\nOn December 14, 2022, red onions in a bag made of plastic netting stored directly on the floor within 6” from where apparent REPs were observed outside the main office in the (b)(4) side of the warehouse.\nOn December 14, 2022, stagnant clear liquid on the floor of coolers (b)(4) and (b)(4) creating a potential attractant for pests and a potential harborage area for bacteria in the (b)(4) area of the warehouse.\nOn December 19, 2022, what appeared to be apparent rodent-gnawed material, apparent REPs TNTC, and insulation used as apparent rodent nesting material in the equipment storage trailer that is permanently affixed to the outside of the (b)(4) wall.\n\n3. You did not maintain your facility’s grounds in a condition adequate to protect food from becoming contaminated, as required by 21 CFR 117.20(a)(1). Specifically, on December 14, 2022, an overgrowth of weeds and vegetation were observed outside on the eastern and northern sides of the warehouse, creating potential harborage areas for pests.\n\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products.
