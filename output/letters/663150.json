Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), this product is a device because it is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nWe received responses from you, dated May 3, 2023, June 19, 2023, August 3, 2023, and September 8, 2023 concerning our investigator(s)’ observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, that was issued to your firm and concerns related to the Impella Connect System, which were discussed during our inspection close out meeting. We address these responses below, in relation to each of the noted violations.\n\nOur inspection also revealed the Impella Connect System device is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g).\n\nThis is based on our review of the evidence, including the Impella Connect Website Instructions, which indicate the Impella Connect System is a device. Specifically, the Impella Connect System comprises a web-based user portal (software) and a remote link module (hardware) that are designed to work with the Automated Impella Controller (AIC), which is part of a medical device system that provides temporary ventricular support to help a patient’s heart to pump blood in a critical care setting. The Impella Connect System allows users to remotely monitor the performance of an individual AIC pump or multiple pumps and view case information on demand, as well as to filter notifications by alarm status. For example, the Impella Connect System Website Instructions describe email notifications of alarms (pages 12-14) at initiation of the alarm and an additional notification for alarms that are still occurring after 15 minutes (page 14), and displays of case tiles, which include pump metrics and alarm state (page 9), which are color coded (red: critical, yellow: serious, green: no alarm) (pages 22-23). These features are software device functions requiring premarket authorization because the notifications and view of the active AIC case status provide patient-specific medical information to detect a life-threatening condition and generate time-critical alarms intended to notify a health-care provider. These are functions that meet the definition of a device in section 201(h) of the Act.\n\nYour firm’s written response dated May 3, 2023, is not adequate because it states that the device functions of the Impella Connect System are Non-Device Clinical Decision Support (“CDS”) Software functions as described in section 520(o)(1)(E) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(o)(1)(E) or Non-Device Medical Device Data Systems (“MDDS”) as described in section 520(o)(1)(D) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(o)(1)(D), and therefore not subject to FDA device regulation. For example, as stated in attachment A-14 page 7 of your written response, you note the Impella Connect System software provides clinical users with the ability to “receive email notifications based on the AIC alert trigger data that is streamed to the cloud.” Additionally, as stated in Attachment A-14 pages 5-6 of your written response, the Impella Connect System software enables clinicians to view “case tile pump metrics” which “displays information equivalent to what is communicated on the AIC” and “each individual case tile includes a color (green, yellow, or red) which is indicative of the AIC/case.” You assert that these features are Non-Device CDS functions because they support a health care provider “as it provides a concise and user-friendly view of active AIC case status” and “concise notifications.” We disagree. These notifications and view of the active AIC case status provide time-critical alarms with patient-specific medical information intended to trigger potential clinical intervention to assure patient safety. By functioning as a secondary alarm system with color-coded tiles and pre-set thresholds to notify users by email of alarms issuing from the AIC, the Impella Connect System fails to meet criterion 3 of Non-Device CDS Software in section 520(o)(1)(E)(ii) because it does not support or provide recommendations to a health care professional about prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition. Though some functions of the Impella Connect System may be Non-Device-MDDS, the case tile displays color coded to alarm state and email notifications of alarms that are described in your response, provide patient-specific medical information to detect a life-threatening condition and display time-critical alarms intended to notify a health-care provider, which are functions that meet the definition of a device under the Act and therefore require premarket authorization.\n\nFor a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. 21 CFR 807.81(b). The kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the device is described on the Internet at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/device-advice-comprehensive-regulatory-assistance/how-study-and-market-your-device.\n\nThe FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed.\n\nThe inspection also revealed that your devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\n\n1. Failure to identify the actions needed to correct and prevent recurrence of nonconforming product and other quality problems, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(3).\nSpecifically, your firm failed to follow procedure SOP-PD31, Rev A (section 6.1, Triggers for initiating an HHE) where a “HHE form is utilized to analyze and evaluate risk(s) associated with product that has been released for distribution and meets at least one of the criteria below:” “Product nonconformance with a Major or Critical severity.” In addition, your firm failed to follow procedure SOP-RA02, Rev.K (Product Recall, Corrections, Removals and Advisory Notices) that requires “Quality Management will perform a health hazard evaluation and incident investigation as appropriate. The decision will be made to initiate a FSCA, recall or correction/removal based on this evaluation.” For example:\n\nA) CAPA-00055 was initiated on February 4, 2020 for Purge Sidearm Leaks and Damage for the Impella 5.5 in response to complaints of purge sidearm leaks that occurred at an unacceptable elevated rate with final risk assessment Severity Level (b)(4) (major) and Occurrence (b)(4) (extreme). Your firm failed to conduct health hazard evaluations and issue formal recall actions for distributed medical devices based on risk to health.\n\nB) CAPA-00095 was initiated December 1, 2021 for Purge Sidearm Yellow Luer Failure for the Impella 5.5 in response to complaints of sidearm damage, purge system leaks, luer leaks or pump stops with final risk assessment Severity Level (b)(4) (major) and Occurrence (b)(4) (high). Your firm failed to conduct a health hazard evaluation and issue formal recall action for distributed medical devices based on risk to health. Your firm must provide for control and action to be taken on devices distributed, and those not yet distributed, that are suspected of having potential nonconformities.\n\nYour firm’s initial response dated May 3, 2023, is not adequate with respect to CAPA 000131, issued April 18, 2023 where “the criteria for triggering escalation of significant quality issues with potential impact to safety and performance of product in the field, requiring an HHE and evaluation for Field action is not clearly defined.” In this case, your procedures are defined but were not appropriately implemented by your firm so as to correct and prevent recurrence of nonconforming product and other quality problems. Specifically, your firm failed to implement procedure SOP-PD31, Rev A (section 6.1, Triggers for initiating an HHE) where a “HHE form is utilized to analyze and evaluate risk(s) associated with product that has been released with a Major or Critical severity.” Both CAPA’s (CAPA-00055 and CAPA -00095) final risk assessments were a severity level (b)(4) (major), but no HHEs were performed by your firm. In addition, your firm failed to follow procedure SOP-RA02, Rev.K (Product Recall, Corrections, Removals and Advisory Notices) that requires “Quality Management will perform a health hazard evaluation and incident investigation as appropriate. The decision will be made to initiate a FSCA, recall or correction/removal based on this evaluation;” CAPA-00055 was initiated on February 4, 2020 for Purge Sidearm Leaks and Damage for the Impella 5.5 in response to complaints of purge sidearm leaks that occurred at an unacceptable elevated rate with final risk assessment Severity Level (b)(4) (major) and Occurrence (b)(4) (extreme). CAPA-00095 was initiated December 1, 2021 for Purge Sidearm Yellow Luer Failure for the Impella 5.5 in response to complaints of sidearm damage, purge system leaks, luer leaks or pump stops with final risk assessment Severity Level (b)(4) (major) and Occurrence (b)(4) (high), but no correction or removal (recall) was initiated until FDA conducted the most recent inspection at your firm on March 1, 2023 through April 13, 2023.\n\n2. Failure to verify or validate the corrective and preventive action to ensure that such action is effective and does not adversely affect the finished device, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(4).\n\nSpecifically, your firm failed to follow procedure SOP-QA45, Incident Investigation, Revision A, which states under section 9.0 “Recommendations” that “at the completion of the incident analysis and root cause, the investigation team should provide recommendations for next steps” and that “the output of the incident investigation may result in the creation of a CAPA.” For example:\n\nA) On 1/25/22, Incident Investigation 11-074 Rev. A (“Burr on Impeller CP below (b)(4) to (b)(4)”) was initiated for a burr on Impeller CP identified on AU rotor pump 350. “The burr can not be avoided due to the mold and impeller design.” Your firm implemented a Quality Notification Deviation (QN No. 210008359, closed out on 9/9/22) involving a “(b)(4)” for an inspection of the parts for a Burr and complete removal of a burr with a (b)(4) since the (b)(4) process does not “completely remove the burr between lower (b)(4) edge and (b)(4)”. “Subsequently, the area was polished with the (b)(4)”. All changes within the deviation were implemented by your firm without verifying the process steps did not adversely affect the finished device.\n\nB) On 10/13/22 an incident investigation was initiated for a software systemic issue/bug involving (b)(4) lots of Impella CP where a software counter that is supposed to reset after a test is complete was not resetting, until the next software application closure/reboot. “The bug in the software responsible for amending new report data carried over from the previous test has been identified and corrected in the source code.” However, your firm failed to validate your corrective action (which involved a software bug fix implemented in AFQ version (b)(4) software code base from previous software AFQ version (b)(4), which could impact the intended use of the device) to ensure that such action was effective.\n\nWe reviewed your firm’s responses and concluded they are not adequate. Your firm’s responses do not address the impact from the complete removal of a burr with a (b)(4).\n\nSubsequently, the area was polished with a (b)(4). All changes within the deviation were implemented by your firm without verifying the additional process steps of removing a burr with a (b)(4) and polishing with a (b)(4) did not adversely affect the finished device. Your initial assessment response also states on page 16, “the engineering study confirmed that there were no burrs coming loose and hemolysis test results were acceptable”. This statement in your response confirms that there are burrs. However, your firm’s initial response included attachment A-2.5 ICL-Material Handling Pump CP, which states on page 4, “particles that cannot be removed on the surface of the impeller, the inner surface of the component housing are always unacceptable!” In addition, attachment A-2.3 (Article Specification 0048-3007) page 7 included with your initial response also states, “Burr at edge of impeller is not acceptable.”\n\nIn addition, we cannot determine if your 9/8/23 response is adequate at this time since your firm plans on conducting (b)(4) post-corrective action (effectiveness action expected to be completed on (b)(4)) to ensure that the performance qualification (PQ), including code review was properly completed during the software qualification (attachment C-2-2 page 9).\n\n3. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints to assure that complaints are evaluated to determine whether the complaint represents an event which is required to be reported to FDA under part 803 of this chapter, Medical Device Reporting, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(a)(3).\n\nSpecifically, your firm has failed to follow SOP-RA15, Global Regulatory Reporting section 6.2 which states “an MDR is required when a manufacturer receives or becomes aware of information that reasonably suggests that one of its marketed devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury.” Section 6.2.4 also states MDR reporting timeframes to FDA are 30 calendar days for events of death, serious injury, or malfunction of a device that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur, as per 21 CFR 803.50. In addition, section 4.3 of the same procedure provides the definition of “caused or contribute” to include medical device events occurring as a result of “User Error.” In this case, the Impella devices involved were used beyond the indicated use (User Error) and as such you initially determined the event was not FDA reportable and did not further evaluate the events. However, as outlined in SOP-RA15, an event that occurred as a result of “User Error” is also an event that could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury and could be attributed to your medical device. As a result, your firm failed to submit MDR reports within 30 days of becoming aware of a device malfunction as per 21 CFR 803.50. For example:\n\nA) Complaint 20-04410-1 for Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist Set (aware date 12/14/20) involved patient support for about 5 minutes after implant and then pump stopped and could not be restarted due to blood ingress as a result of a broken purge side arm. On December 21, 2020, your firm decided not to report since the “pump had been utilized for support beyond the indicated use (ran for 24 days, user error) and as such the event is not FDA reportable.” However, on 3/9/23 your firm decided that this malfunction was reportable to FDA (MDR report # 1220648-2023-01944), which is more than 30 days based on your awareness date of 12/14/20.\n\nB) Complaint 21-04692-1, awareness date 1/19/21, documents “an Impella 5.5 was running with sodium bicarbonate in the purge. The device stopped when the patient was in the ICU and the pump was not able to be restarted.” “The device was returned for review and found to have a broken yellow luer on the purge sidearm.” “The catheter jacket was opened to confirm that blood had ingressed into the motor due to the broken purge sidearm.” On January 27, 2021, your firm decided not to report to FDA since the device supported a patient for 17 days and stopped after 17 days which “was beyond the indicated use and as such is not reportable for the malfunction.” However, on 3/9/23 your firm decided that this malfunction was reportable to FDA since “the stop is reportable malfunction to the FDA” (MDR report # 1220648-2023-01947), which is more than 30 days based on your awareness date of 1/19/21.\n\nC) Complaint 21-05733-1, awareness date 4/22/21, documents an Impella 5.5 where the pump ran for at least 5 minutes after implant and resulted in a stoppage that could not be restarted. The root cause of the pump stop was a lapse in purge flow to the motor, from the damaged luer, allowing blood to enter and stop the motor. The pump stopped on day 17 of use which is beyond pump indication of use. “The pump was explanted and replaced as the patient bridges to VAD, not reportable, no lasting harm or injury from the pump stop.” However, on March 9, 2023, your firm decided this complaint was reportable to FDA since the device is a full support pump and the stop could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, which is a reportable malfunction to the FDA. This is more than 30 days since your awareness date was 4/22/21.\n\nD) Complaint 21-07489-1 with an awareness date of 10/17/21 documents a Impella 5.5 purge sidearm cracked 20 days into support. The motor current increased and ultimately lead to a pump stoppage that could not be restarted. Sodium bicarbonate was used in the purge solution 2 days into support. The pump was removed with no additional pump support provided to the patient. So, the cause of the pump stop was blood ingress due to sidearm yellow luer damage from the use of sodium bicarbonate. “Although the pump stopped with this Impella 5.5, it occurred beyond the intended use life, and therefore, is not considered reportable for this issue.” However, on 3/9/23, your firm stated “as the 5.5 is a full support pump this malfunction is reportable to FDA,” which is more than 30 days of your awareness date of 10/17/21, MDR 1220648-2023-01945.\n\nE) Complaint 22-11942-1, awareness date of 10/31/22, documents an Impella 5.5 pump stopped roughly 30 days after implant. The pump stop “was attributed to there being no purge solution in the system.” “No MDR required.” However, you firm filed an MDR on 4/24/2023 which is more than 30 days of your awareness date of 10/31/22, MDR 1220648-2023-02052.\n\nThe adequacy of your responses cannot be determined at this time. Your firm’s August 03, 2023, response states 254 complaint records were reviewed as part of your (b)(4) retrospective review on page 470. Of the 254 complaints, “51 records were identified as requiring a product history review.” Aug. 3, 2023 Abiomed response, page 470. The records that required a Product History Review for a malfunction related to a manufacturing issue were “pump stops due to bearing wear” and “Optical Sensor wear/placement signal drift.” You conclude the 51 product history reviews conducted did not require additional actions or escalation. However, no records were provided for review to verify that none of the 51 product history reviews conducted required additional actions or escalation.\n\nOur inspection also revealed that your firm’s Impella Pumps are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 - Medical Device Reporting. Significant violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to submit a report to FDA no later than 30 calendar days after the day that your firm received or otherwise became aware of information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that a device that your firm markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, as required by 21 CFR 803.50(a)(1). For example, the information included for Complaints 22-08541-1 and 22-11652-1 describes events where a patient expired after receiving treatment with the Impella Systems. There is no information reasonably suggesting that the device might not be a contributing factor leading to the patients’ deaths. As such, the referenced events meet the criteria for MDR reportable deaths. Your firm became aware of the event for complaint 22-08541-1 on January 14, 2022, and for complaint 22-11652-1 on July 5, 2022. The corresponding MDRs 1220648-2022-01321 and MDR 1220648-2022-01642, were received by FDA on March 18, 2022, and October 28, 2022, respectively, which is beyond the 30-calendar day timeframe after becoming aware.\n\n2. Failure to submit a report to FDA no later than 30 calendar days after the day that your firm received or otherwise became aware of information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that a device that your firm markets has malfunctioned and this device or a similar device that your firm markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur, as required by 21 CFR 803.50(a)(2). Specifically,\n\nA) The information included for Complaints 22-11204-1, 22-12305-1, 22-11774-1, 22-10492-1, 22-11921-1, 22-10957-1, 22-10263-1, 22-11950-1, 21-07906-1, 21-07081-1, 21-08235-1, 22-11942-1 reasonably suggests that your firm’s Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist system malfunctioned (i.e., cracks and leaks from the yellow luer lock and purge cassette) while in use. Your firm initiated the recall Z-1590-2023 for the referenced malfunction. Per the Preamble, in the Medical Devices; Medical User Facility and Manufacturer Reporting, Certification and Registration; Final Rule, 60 Fed. Reg. 63758, 63585 (Dec. 11, 1995), Comment 12, a malfunction is reportable if the manufacturer takes or would be required to take an action under sections 518 or 519(g) of the act as a result of the malfunction of the device or other similar devices. As such, the referenced complaints meet the definition of a reportable malfunction, as defined in 21 CFR 803.3. There is no information included for the complaints that rules out that the device may not have caused or contributed to the referenced malfunctions.\n\nHowever, your firm failed to submit MDRs for each of the referenced complaints.\n\nB) The information included for Complaints 23-12755-1, 23-12965-1, 23-13350-1, 23-13389-1, 23-13374-1, 23-13445-1, 23-13368-1, 23-13308-1, and 23-13377-1 reasonably suggests your firm’s Impella Pumps malfunctioned while in use, leading to inadequate support, loss of support, ischemia or hemolysis. The information from the complaints state that there was indication of patient impact (explant, device replacement, angioplasty). Per the Preamble, in the Medical Devices; Medical User Facility and Manufacturer Reporting, Certification and Registration; Final Rule, 60 Fed. Reg. 63758, 63585 (December 11, 1995), Comment 12, a malfunction is reportable if the manufacturer takes or would be required to take an action under sections 518 or 519(g) of the act as a result of the malfunction of the device or other similar devices. There is no information included for the complaints that rules out that the referenced device malfunction would not be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Although your firm submitted the MDRs (MDR#1220648-2023-01775, 1220648-2023-01811, 1220648-2023-01910, 1220648-2023-01926, 1220648-2023-01929, 1220648-2023-01930, 1220648-2023-01932, 1220648-2023-01933 and 1220648-2023-01934) corresponding to each of the referenced complaints, the MDRs were not received by FDA within the required 30 calendar day timeframe.\n\nThe adequacy of your firm’s responses dated May 3, 2023, June 19, 2023, and August 3, 2023 cannot be determined at this time. The responses note that your firm initiated CAPA-000120 to investigate the root cause of the late reporting issue. Your firm also plans to conduct further root cause analysis and take additional corrective and preventive actions including a (b)(4) retrospective review of complaints for reportability. Your firm states that as part of its corrective and preventive action it plans to include hiring and training of staff to enable timely processing of MDR reportable complaint files. However, documentation or evidence of completed corrective actions was not provided for all corrective actions and preventive actions as they are still ongoing. Your firm aims to hire and train staff to enable timely processing of reportable complaint files by (b)(4). Your firm aims to complete the retrospective review and submit the MDRs by (b)(4).\n\nOur inspection also revealed that your firm’s Impella Pumps are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 806 – Medical Devices; Reports of Corrections and Removals. Significant violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. A correction or removal, conducted to reduce a risk to health posed by a device, was not reported in writing to FDA within 10-working days of initiating such correction or removal, as required by 21 CFR 806.10(b). Specifically, your firm communicated to the Field Team and through website postings of Technical Bulletins and Product Updates for the Impella 5.5 to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, but did not communicate such correction or removal to FDA. For example:\n\nA) Your firm initiated a medical device correction through a Technical Bulletin, Reminder of Impella 5.5 with SmartAssist Best Practices for Purge Management dated April 2020. The purpose was to reduce a risk to health due to purge sidearm damage and fluid leaking from the purge sidearm of the pump, which prompts alarms and could lead to low purge pressure and flow, resulting in pump stop and loss of therapy. You note that purge sidearm damage and fluid leaking from the purge sidearm of the pump of your device could lead to loss of ventricular support and cause serious injury or death. The Bulletin reminded users to follow the IFU, added best practices, and instructed users how to request a Sidearm Retainer. Your firm did not submit a Report of Correction or Removal to FDA for this action.\n\nB) Your firm initiated a medical device correction through an Impella Update, Use of Sodium Bicarbonate in Impella Pumps, dated November 18, 2021. The purpose was to reduce a risk to health due to leaks in the yellow luer lock on the purge sidearm when sodium bicarbonate has been used as a heparin alternative in the purge solution. This leak may contribute to the pump stopping as adequate purge flow may not be maintained. Pump stoppage leads to loss of ventricular support, which may cause serious injury or death. The Update alerted users to the risk of sodium bicarbonate use especially in longer duration device use, recommended they follow the IFU, instructed physicians to contact Abiomed Customer Service for remedies to the leak problem, and informed users that changing the material of the yellow luer as a future mitigation is being designed. Your firm did not submit a Report of Correction or Removal to FDA for this action.\n\nYour firm’s responses, dated May 3, 2023, June 19, 2023, and August 3, 2023, are not adequate. Your firm submitted a Report of Correction or Removal (806 Report) for corrections to Impella 5.5 devices to remedy two root causes of purge leaks during an FDA directed inspection of your facility in March 2023. Subsequent revisions of the 806 Report and corresponding new customer notification letter include the removal of Impella 5.5 devices which do not have the design changes described in your pre-market submission for the sidearm retainer (P140003/S087- August 2021) and new sodium bicarbonate-compatible luer (P140003/S091 - March 2022). This appears to adequately address the specific examples in Observation 1; however, as evidenced below, the systemic failure to file reports of correction and removal when medical device corrections are made has not been addressed.\n\nYour firm’s response dated June 19, 2023, includes HHEs resulting from a retrospective review of all Impella Technical Bulletins/Updates issued within the last 2 years. Some of these HHEs describe medical device corrections initiated to reduce a risk to health. Your firm failed to submit a written report to FDA within 10 working days of initiation of the following Technical Bulletins/Product Updates.\n\n1. HHE-2023-010 evaluates Technical Bulletin IMP-2643, Recommendations for Avoiding Iatrogenic LV Perforation with the Impella Heart Pumps, which was approved for distribution in October 2021. This bulletin addressed the risk of operator mishandling of the Impella left ventricular devices resulting in iatrogenic ventricular wall perforation. Impella Update IMP-2643 contained best practices, including two items not in the product’s IFU: Consider repositioning the Impella 5.5 to a temporarily shallower position during surgery and Clinicians are cautioned to carefully position the Impella catheter and manipulate the heart during an operative procedure. The risk of iatrogenic LV perforation during operative procedures exists when the heart is manipulated in the presence of any semi-rigid cannulas placed in the LV.\n\nHHE-2023-010 explains that heart perforation is a known complication of intracardiac procedures; the risk management documents for the Impella devices account for the potential risk and the rate of the complaints received before and after the publication of the technical bulletin is unchanged. However, Impella Update IMP-2643 was initiated with the intention of reducing the risk of LV perforation. The update contains cautions that are not in the IFU. Therefore, this action is a medical device correction initiated to reduce a risk to health, for which your firm is required to submit a Report of Correction or Removal to FDA.\n\n2. HHE-2023-008 evaluates Impella Update IMP-1130-16, Recommendation to Avoid Synthetic or Cotton Fiber Contact with Impella Heart Pump, approved for distribution March 2016. This update was triggered by complaints in which fibers from the catheterization laboratory/operating room environment may have been inadvertently picked up and led to entrainment of the impeller and result in low flow of the Impella device. Ingestion of material into an Impella Heart Pump can result in low pump flow, purge pressure, clot formation along the internal blood flow path, and the secondary failure of pump stop leading to loss of therapy. The HHE states that currently, the IFUs for Impella devices do not have a caution notice for fibers. Impella Update IMP-1130-16 was initiated with the intention of reducing the risk of fiber entrapment in the impeller, which can lead to loss of therapy. The update contains cautions that are not in the IFU. Therefore, this action is a medical device correction initiated to reduce a risk to health, for which your firm is required to submit a Report of Correction or Removal to FDA.\n\n3. HHE-2023-006 evaluates Product Update AIC-0112, AIC Version 8.5 Software Update Available, which was approved for distribution March 2021. The Product Update was triggered by complaints that the Impella catheter was not detected during case start, the user will not be able to complete case start and initiate patient support, or patient support will not be resumed after transfer to another Impella Controller. AIC-0112 informed users that the Impella version 8.5 software for the Automated Impella Controller (AIC) contain bug fixes and additional data sent to Impella Connect. This software will resolve an issue seen in version 8.4 where a pump is not recognized by the AIC. While version 8.5 is being rolled out, instructions are provided on troubleshooting should this error occur. Product Update AIC-0112 was initiated with the intention of remedying a device failure to perform as intended, which may present a risk to health caused by a delay of therapy. Therefore, this action is a medical device correction initiated to remedy a violation which may present a risk to health, for which your firm is required to submit a Report of Correction or Removal to FDA.\n\nYour firm should take prompt action to address any violations identified in this letter. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties.\n\nOther federal agencies may take your compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations into account when considering the award of federal contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been addressed. Should FDA determine that your devices or facilities do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to address the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address any violations included in this Warning Letter. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration as part of your response.\n\nYour firm’s response should be sent to: Gina Brackett, Director of Compliance Branch, at oradevices1firmresponse@fda.hhs.gov. Refer to CMS # 663150 when replying. If you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Robert Maffei, Compliance Officer, at 973-331-4906 or Robert.Maffei@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of any violations and take prompt actions to address any violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n/S/\n\nJoseph Matrisciano, Jr.\nProgram Division Director\nOffice of Medical Device and Radiological Health\nDivision 1/East\n\n/S/\n\nBram Zuckerman, MD\nDirector\nOHT 2: Office of Cardiovascular Devices\nOffice of Product Evaluation and Quality\nCenter for Devices and Radiological Health",
