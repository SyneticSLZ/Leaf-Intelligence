Certain tobacco products, including ENDS products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\n\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\n\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS products that lack a marketing authorization order: Elfbar Tropical Rainbow Blast 5000 puffs, Lost Mary Berry Crush Ice 5000 puffs, and Lost Mary OS5000 Forest Mint.\n\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C.§ 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)).\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion.\n\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to adequately address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that these products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov.\n\nPlease note your reference number, RW2502259 in your response and direct your response via email at CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov and to the following address:\n\nDPAL-WL Response, Office of Compliance and Enforcement  \nFDA Center for Tobacco Products  \nc/o Document Control Center  \nBuilding 71, Room G335  \n10903 New Hampshire Avenue  \nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nIf you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nJohn E.

These products include devices under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n\nLack of Marketing Authorization\n\nOur inspection and review of your firm’s website (https://www.nextscience.com/) determined that the XPERIENCE®, BLASTX® and SURGX® products are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g) for the products, as described and marketed. These products are also misbranded under section 502(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the products into interstate commerce for commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). For a product requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. 21 CFR 807.81(b).\n\nThe kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for a device is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed. Our office requests that your firm cease any activities that result in the misbranding or adulteration of the products.\n\nXPERIENCE®\n\nYour XPERIENCE® product was cleared under K203835 as MIS Solution with the following indications for use: “MIS Solution is indicated for use in cleansing and removal of debris, including microorganisms, from wounds.” However, based on our inspection and review of your firm’s website, FDA is aware that you are marketing these products without clearance or approval for the following uses in your marketing materials and website (https://www.nextscience.com/xperience/), including but not limited to:\n\n“XPERIENCE rinses away debris and microorganisms from the surgical wound site.”\n“XPERIENCE does not have cytotoxic effects on osteoblasts. Cell viability and bone growth and healing were shown to be more favorable compared to 10% Betadine.”\n“XPERIENCE is cleared for use in a variety of orthopedic surgeries, including arthroplasty, orthopedic trauma, spine, podiatric, and plastics.”\n“XPERIENCE is compatible with most commonly used implants, including hydroxyapatite (HA) coated implants, and closure methods.”\n“XPERIENCE compatibility with surgical implants and closure methods (316 Stainless Steel, Chrome Alloy, Nylon Sutures, Polyethylene Sutures, Polyethylene, Polydimethylsulfoxide, Polyethylene Sutures, Polysulphone, Silk Sutures, Titanium, Tivanium and Hydroxyapatit Implants).”\n“5+ hours of ongoing, broad-spectrum efficacy.”\n\nThese claims were not reviewed as part of your premarket notification materials submitted to FDA and do not appear to be within the scope of the clearance issued under K203835. These claims also appear to constitute major changes or modifications in the intended use and could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product that would require submission of a new marketing application. We also note that some of the claims raise jurisdictional issues, and if you intend to continue making such claims, the product may be regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and subject to drug requirements. Please note that the claims and indications for a product can impact the regulatory pathway of the product, as well as the classification of or jurisdiction of FDA over the product.\n\nThe agency previously expressed concerns with the use of XPERIENCE® in deep (surgical) wounds. However, you continue to market XPERIENCE® with the cited claims. For example:\n\nOn March 3, 2019, the FDA provided feedback in K203835, Additional Information Letter which stated that the intended use of your device is for use on breached or compromised skin. Any claims regarding the use of the XPERIENCE® product for deep wound cavities, fissures and wound pockets are not cleared under product code FRO (dressing, wound, drug), and require submission of a 510(k) for FDA review.\n(b)(4) to conduct an Investigational Device Exemption Study to expand the use of the XPERIENCE® product for the use in colorectal surgical wounds. (b)(4), the FDA communicated our concern regarding the hemocompatibility of XPERIENCE® product, indicating that it is likely hemolytic. The FDA raised concern that hemocompatibility testing or scientific rationale is needed to evaluate the risk of using the XPERIENCE® product in surgical wounds. You have not provided any additional hemocompatibility report and have not been granted clearance for use of XPERIENCE® in deep (surgical) wounds.\n\nBLASTX®\n\nYour BLASTX® product was cleared under K150792 as Next ScienceTM Wound Gel for Over-The-Counter Use with the following indications for use: “Next ScienceTM Wound Gel is indicated for the management of skin abrasions, lacerations, minor irritations, cuts, exit sites and intact skin.” However, based on our inspection and review of your firm’s website, FDA is aware that your firm is marketing this product without clearance or approval for the following uses in your marketing materials and website (https://www.nextscience.com/blastx-wound-gel/), including but not limited to:\n\n“BLASTX® can be applied once daily for up to 30 days.”\n“BLASTX® has been shown to suppress inflammation and repair the skin’s barrier function.”\n“BLASTX® inactivates matrix Metalloproteases (MMPs), leading to stopping the cytokine cascade. Also, BLASTX® inactivates proteases production by the bacteria, which prevents tissue destruction and inflammation by the same mechanism.”\n“Lowers inflammation allowing transition to proliferative stage.”\n“BLASTX® Results in Fewer Days with Wounds, Fewer Amputations.”\n\nThese claims were not reviewed as part of your premarket notification materials submitted to FDA and are outside the scope of the clearance issued under K150792. These claims also appear to constitute major changes or modifications in the intended use of the product that require submission of a new marketing application. We also note that some of the claims raise jurisdictional issues, and if you intend to continue making such claims, the product may be regulated by CDER. Please note that the claims and indications for a product can impact the regulatory pathway of the product, as well as the classification of or jurisdiction of FDA over the product.\n\nSURGX®\n\nYour SURGX® product was cleared under K163188 as Next Science nonsterile wound gel for Prescription Use and with the following indications for use: “Next Science Wound Gel (Rx) is indicated for the management of wounds such as Stage I-IV pressure ulcers, partial and full thickness wounds, diabetic foot and leg ulcers, post-surgical wounds, first- and second-degree burns, grafted and donor sites.” However, based on our inspection and review of your firm’s website, FDA is aware that your firm is marketing this product without clearance or approval for the following uses in your marketing materials and website, including but not limited to:\n\n“SURGX® Sterile Antimicrobial Gel as sterilized by gamma radiation for one time use.”\n“SURGX® is designed to reduce surgical site and post-surgical infections by destroying planktonic and biofilm-encased bacteria within the gel. The proprietary, non-toxic formulation conforms to the postoperative wound to provide proven broad spectrum and sustained effectiveness for up to 5 days.”\n\nThese claims were not reviewed as part of your premarket notification materials submitted to FDA and are outside the scope of the clearance issued under K163188. These claims also appear to constitute major changes or modifications in the intended use of the product that require submission of a new marketing application. We also note that some of the claims raise jurisdictional issues, and if you intend to continue making such claims, the product may be regulated by CDER. Please note that the claims and indications for a product can impact the regulatory pathway of the product, as well as the classification of or jurisdiction of FDA over the product.\n\nAdditionally, your firm is currently marketing the XPERIENCE®, BLASTX® and SURGX® products as powered by XBIO® Technology. Our inspection and the review of your website (https://www.nextscience.com/) indicates you are making the following claims for XBIO® Technology:\n\n“Since 2012, Next Science has been developing revolutionary material science-based technology that is non-toxic with proven efficacy against bacteria and microorganisms. This technology is called XBIO®.”\n“XBIO™ Technology deconstructs biofilm by removing the metal ions holding it together.”\n“XBIO Technology takes an innovative approach to solving the problem of bacterial biofilms. The unique, non-toxic technology attacks and deconstructs the structure of the biofilm by removing the metal ions that hold the EPS together. This exposes the bacteria within the biofilm, making them more vulnerable to eradication. Bacteria that are enveloped within the XBIO Technology are then destroyed by the combination of a surfactant and high osmotic imbalance across the bacterial cell wall. XBIO Technology’s broad-spectrum efficacy helps defend from biofilm reformation, reducing the rate of reoccurrence by over 100X. Due to this unique mechanism of action there is no known resistance to XBIO Technology.”\n“XBIO gives physicians the transformational technology to help improve surgical outcomes for even their most at-risk patients.”\n“Through our anti-biofilm solutions, it is our purpose to help reduce infections and combat the rising problem of antimicrobial resistance.”\n“At Next Science, we are leading a paradigm shift with a unique approach to eradicating both biofilm bacteria and planktonic bacteria with our XBIO Technology. XBIO disrupts the biofilm’s extracellular polymeric substance and exposes the bacteria, once protected by the biofilm, leaving it more vulnerable to attack.”\n\nFrom the review of your marketing material, you claim XBIO® Technology deconstructs biofilm by removing the metal ions holding biofilm together. The claims indicate that XBIO® Technology has effect on biofilm. XPERIENCE®, BLASTX® and SURGX® have not been evaluated for safety and effectiveness against biofilm. As communicated to you during the regulatory meeting held on May 5, 2022, the antimicrobial component found in your 510(k) cleared products are intended to function as a preservative that inhibits growth of microorganisms in the products and claims of effectiveness against biofilm are outside the clearance of XPERIENCE®, BLASTX® and SURGX®. Additionally, the claims found in our inspection and review of your website go beyond the types of claims appropriate for wound dressings and wound washes categorized under the FRO product code. Further, the claims raise jurisdictional issues, and if you intend to continue making such claims, we note that the products may be regulated by CDER and subject to drug requirements.\n\nQuality System Regulation (QSR) Violations\n\nThis inspection also revealed that these products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\n\nWe received your responses dated September 26, 2024, November 21, 2024, and January 15, 2025, concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, that was issued to your firm. We address this response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n1. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for validating the device design to ensure that devices conform to defined user needs and intended uses and include testing of production units under actual or simulated use conditions, and include risk analysis where appropriate, as required by, 21 CFR 820.30(g). Specifically,\n\na. Your firm did not provide evidence to demonstrate that the design of XPERIENCE® was validated for the uses claimed in the product labeling and marketing material. Design validation activities for XPERIENCE® (MIS Solution FDA 510(k) K203835) were conducted for cleansing and removal of debris, including microorganisms, from external topical wounds, but your firm markets the solution as “cleared for use in a variety of orthopedic surgeries, including arthroplasty, orthopedic trauma, spine, podiatric, and plastics,” areas that may pose a greater risk and potential adverse effects because of the access to blood vessels and bone. Your firm did not conduct additional blood compatibility studies when establishing the biocompatibility assessment of XPERIENCE® that would be relevant for the uses marketed by your firm. Without this information, there are outstanding questions related to hemolysis risks from the use of this product as marketed by your firm.\n\nb. Your firm did not present design validation studies to support the biofilm disruption mechanism of action currently promoted on your products’ labeling and marketing material. Specifically, your firm’s wound gels and irrigation solutions are labeled as “Powered by XBio®.” Your firm’s website explains that XBio® is a proprietary non-toxic technology platform that disrupts the biofilm’s EPS matrix by removing the metal ions holding it together without inhibiting new tissue growth, offers no known opportunity for bacteria resistance, and removes bacteria from the treated surface and defends against biofilm recurrence.\n\nc. Your firm failed to conduct design validation studies to support the website claim that SURGX® provides broad-spectrum efficacy and multi-log reduction within the gel for fungus C. albicans and A. brasiliensis.\n\nYour responses indicate that you have opened CAPA 0029 in response to this observation and that the marketing materials were placed on your firm’s website by a marketing associate without going through the formal review and approval process. Your responses indicate that your firm did not intend to plan and promote these products for the uses described above. Your responses also indicate that you have corrected your website and that your firm will review all currently approved marketing materials to verify that there is supporting evidence for each claim and will remove any claims without such evidence. Your responses indicate that you have hired a Director of Marketing with experience related to medical devices. In addition, your responses stated that you have reopened your Risk Management Plan and initiated a comprehensive reevaluation of risk management activities in accordance with ISO 14971 to better evaluate potential harms associated with known conditions of use. Your responses also indicated that you will update your firm’s website to clearly differentiate the use of XBIO® Technology in non-FDA regulated applications. In addition, your January 15, 2025, response indicates that your firm has updated several applicable procedures. However, at this time, the adequacy of your corrections cannot be determined at this time. Your corrections are ongoing, and a follow-up inspection will verify the effectiveness of your corrective actions.\n\n2. Failure to establish and maintain procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(a). For example:\nYour firm’s procedure QOP-85-03, Customer Complaints, assigns responsibilities and provides a system and instructions for receiving and processing customer complaints relating to the product. This procedure was not adequately established in that:\n\na. Information collected by your company from February 2022 through January 2023 regarding excessive bleeding caused by XPERIENCE® was not comprehensively evaluated to determine its relationship to the product and to understand the underlying potential mode or mechanism of failure when using the product on breast soft tissue. Specifically, your firm’s Medical Science Liaison Manager informed a clinical site on January 24, 2023, the following about the bleeding reports: “The fluid action coupled with the surfactant and citrates may loosen micro-clots. Moreover, a cleaner space than you usually see with just N/S may make any extant bleeders more obvious. The general approach seems to be to simply slow down and allow those clots to stabilize before commencing aggressive irrigation.” There is no evidence that this information was further investigated to identify failure mode, risk of using the product on breast soft tissue, and any corrective action needed to preclude the bleeding and oozing adverse events. \n\nb. Complaints reporting several events under one report are entered in your complaint system as one complaint, limiting the extent of the investigation to be conducted for each individual case. Specifically, complaints received for XPERIENCE® reporting excessive bleeding did not include the nature and details of each individual case. In addition, data for complaint trending may be artificially lowered by grouping several events under one complaint, for example:\n\ni. Complaint # 00265- a surgeon reported three cases of bleeding he encountered at two different surgery centers.\nii. Complaint # 00266- a surgeon reported two cases of increase in bleeding within the first five minutes after irrigating on capsulectomy cases.\niii. Complaint # 00274- a surgeon reported three cases of oozing and bleeding and one case of hematoma.\niv. Complaint # 00278- a surgeon reported three cases of diffuse bleeding and oozing.\nv. Complaint # 00299- a surgeon reported two cases of diffuse bleeding and one hematoma requiring drainage.\n\nYour responses indicate that you have opened CAPA 0033 and that you have updated your complaint handling module to ask whether new information has been received on a previously closed investigation that would warrant further investigation. Your responses also indicate that you have created a new procedure for Issue Impact Assessments QOP 85-05, and that training was conducted. In addition, your responses indicate that a retrospective review of complaints for all product families and new individual complaint events was opened. Also, your January 15, 2025, response indicates that your firm has updated QOP-82-01 to redefine the process, roles, and responsibilities for the act of reviewing publications, articles, literature reviews and opening complaint report records. We cannot determine the adequacy of your corrective actions at this time. A follow-up inspection will need to be conducted to evaluate the adequacy of the implementation and the effectiveness of your corrective actions.\n\n3. Failure to adequately establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a). Specifically, per your Corrective and Preventive Action procedure QOP-85-004, a reported failure that may pose a significant patient safety risk and/or presents an upward trend of reported events are to be considered sources of corrective and preventive actions. Your firm did not follow this procedure for the XPERIENCE® bleeding complaints in that a CAPA was not opened after receiving at least twenty reports of excessive bleeding after using XPERIENCE® to rinse the breast pocket in breast surgery cases.\n\nYour responses indicate that you have opened CAPA 0036 and determined that the failure occurred because the relevant procedures did not properly trigger CAPA escalation. Your responses indicate that you have modified your procedures and conducted a retrospective review of complaints based on the updated procedures to determine if CAPAs need to be initiated for certain failures. Your January 15, 2025, response indicated that your firm concluded that no new issues required escalation to CAPA when compared against updated Customer Complaints procedure QOP-85-03. Your responses also indicate that you have developed a new procedure QOP-85-05 Issue Impact Assessment in order to have a documented determination for elevation to CAPA. Your responses indicate that the new procedure will require the Issue Impact Assessment be revisited (including CAPA determinations) when failure modes of a similar nature are detected. Your responses also indicate that you have developed a new work instruction that requires the reporting of trending of failure modes for adverse/reportable/IIA events. We cannot determine the adequacy of your corrective actions at this time. A follow-up inspection will need to be conducted to evaluate the implementation and the effectiveness of your corrective actions.\n\nMedical Device Reporting (MDR) Violations\n\nOur inspection also revealed that your firm’s XPERIENCE® solution is misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the product that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 - Medical Device Reporting. Significant violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nFailure to submit a report to FDA no later than 30 calendar days after the day that your firm received or otherwise became aware of information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that a device that your firm markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, as required by 21 CFR 803.50(a)(1). For example:\n\na. The information included for Complaint# 0299 reasonably suggests that a patient sustained an injury (hematoma) following the breast reduction surgery involving your firm’s XPERIENCE® solution, which required percutaneous aspiration. There is no information included in the complaint that rules out that your firm’s XPERIENCE® solution may not have caused or contributed to the referenced injury. Further, the information described in the complaint meets the definition of serious injury under 21 CFR 803.3(w) because medical intervention was necessary to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. Your firm became aware of the event on January 26, 2023, yet the corresponding MDR# 3012271775-2024-00002 was not received by the FDA until October 31, 2024, exceeding the required 30-calendar-day reporting timeframe.\n\nb. The information included for Complaint# 0276 reasonably suggests that a patient sustained an injury (diffuse bleeding) on one breast pocket during a bilateral breast augmentation procedure involving the application of your firm’s XPERIENCE® solution, which required a saline wash and cauterization of the bleeding tissue to manage the situation. There is no information included in the complaint that rules out that your firm’s XPERIENCE® solution may not have caused or contributed to the referenced injury. Further, the information described in the complaint meets the definition of serious injury under 21 CFR 803.3(w) because medical intervention was necessary to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. Your firm became aware of the event on May 12, 2022, yet the corresponding MDR# 3012271775-2024-00004 was not received by the FDA until November 8, 2024, exceeding the required 30-calendar-day reporting timeframe.\n\nWe received your responses dated September 26, 2024, November 21, 2024, and January 15, 2025. Your firm’s responses indicate that corrective actions have been taken to address this observation. These actions include streamlining the MDR reporting process by incorporating an MDR decision tree and conducting a retrospective review of XPERIENCE® complaints related to bleeding for MDR reportability. As a result, we acknowledge receipt of six newly identified MDRs. Additionally, your firm has completed a retrospective review of all complaints from the past three years and confirmed that no additional reportable events were identified. Please note that future FDA inspections or regulatory activities will assess the implementation and effectiveness of your corrective actions.\n\nYour firm should take prompt action to address any violations identified in this letter. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties.\n\nOther federal agencies may take your compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations into account when considering the award of federal contracts. Additionally, should FDA determine that you have Quality System regulation violations that are reasonably related to premarket approval applications for Class III devices, such devices will not be approved until the violations have been addressed. Should FDA determine that your products or facilities do not meet the requirements of the Act, requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFG) may not be granted.\n\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to address the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address any violations included in this Warning Letter. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration as part of your response.\n\nYour firm’s response should be sent to: Melissa Michurski, Assistant Director at CDRHenforcement@fda.hhs.gov. Please include in the subject line, CMS case # 698114 when replying. If you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact: Demetria Lueneburg, Compliance Officer at Demetria.Lueneburg@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of any violations and take prompt actions to address any violations and bring the products into compliance.\n\nSincerely yours,\n/S/\n\nRDML Sean M.

Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\n\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded\n\nFDA has determined that you manufacture and offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order, including: Dew Water.\n\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement.

Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\n\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded\n\nFDA has determined that you manufacture and offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order, including: Barbie Girl.\n\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization.

Certain tobacco products, including e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\n\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\n\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have a premarket authorization in effect. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. § 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387e(j)(3)).\n\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization Are Adulterated and Misbranded\n\nFDA has determined that you manufacture and offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States e-liquid products without a marketing authorization order, including: Madcloud Brandy.\n\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act.\n\nConclusion and Requested Actions\n\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA’s discretion.\n\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute “written notice” for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\n\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to the ones stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\n\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that these products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage at http://www.fda.gov.\n\nPlease note your reference number, ER2501148, in your response and direct your response to the following address:\n\nDEM-WL Response, Office of Compliance and Enforcement  \nFDA Center for Tobacco Products  \nc/o Document Control Center  \nBuilding 71, Room G335  \n10903 New Hampshire Avenue  \nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\n\nIf you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nJohn Verbeten\nDirector\nOffice of Compliance and Enforcement\nCenter for Tobacco Products",

    "fullContent": "Delivery Method:\nVIA UPS\nReference #:\n320-25-53\nProduct:\nDrugs\nRecipient:\nMr. Chenguang Xu\nOwner & CEO\nYangzhou Sion Commodity Co., Ltd.\n\nNo. 168 Longwang Road, Hangji Industrial Park\nYangzhou Shi Jiangsu Sheng, 225111\nChina\n\nIssuing Office:\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER)\n\nUnited States\n\nWarning Letter 320-25-53\n\nMarch 12, 2025\n\nDear Mr. Xu:\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Yangzhou Sion Commodity Co., Ltd., FEI 3011346498, at No. 168 Longwang Road, Hangji Industrial Park, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, from September 23 to 27, 2024.\n\nThis warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).\n\nBecause your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). We reviewed your October 18, 2024 response to our Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence.\n\nCGMP Violations\n\nDuring our inspection, our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.\n\n1. Your firm failed to test samples of each component for identity and conformity with all appropriate written specifications for purity, strength, and quality. Your firm also failed to validate and establish the reliability of your component supplier’s test analyses at appropriate intervals (21 CFR 211.84(d)(1) and 211.84(d)(2)).\n\nYou manufacture over-the-counter (OTC) drug products including (b)(4). Your firm failed to test incoming components used in manufacturing your finished OTC drug products to determine identity, purity, strength, and quality, and your firm did not establish a vendor qualification program for your raw material suppliers.\n\nYour firm used results from your suppliers’ certificates of analysis (COAs) without establishing the reliability of your suppliers’ analyses through appropriate validation and without conducting at least one specific identity test on each incoming lot of components. You may not rely on your suppliers’ COA to verify the identity of your components.\n\nIn previous correspondence on September 28, 2023, associated with an FDA records request under section 704(a)(4) of the act, your firm committed to performing independent testing, to include identity testing for each shipment of high-risk component, as required by 21 CFR 211.84 (d)(1) & (2), using equivalent or better methods to those in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).\n\nHowever during the inspection, and contrary to previous commitments, your firm failed to demonstrate that you adequately tested each shipment of each lot of the incoming components at high-risk of (b)(4) contamination. These include, but are not limited to, testing of (b)(4) solution you used in manufacturing drug products to determine their appropriate identity. Identity testing for these and certain other high-risk drug components1 include a limit test in the USP to ensure that the component meets the relevant safety limits for levels of (b)(4). Because you did not perform identity testing on each shipment of each lot using the USP identification test that detects these hazardous impurities, you failed to assure the acceptability of these components for use in manufacture of your drug products.\n\nThe use of ingredients contaminated with (b)(4) has resulted in various lethal poisoning incidents in humans worldwide. See FDA’s guidance document (b)(4) to help you meet the CGMP requirements when manufacturing drugs containing ingredients at high-risk for (b)(4) contamination at (b)(4).\n\nAdditionally, you failed to perform identity testing on the component (b)(4) and lacked adequate impurities testing on (b)(4) before being used in manufacturing. Furthermore, (b)(4) was not adequately monitored for (b)(4).\n\nIn your response on October 18, 2024, you indicate that you have updated your procedures to mandate the testing of identity and purity of active ingredients and the testing of identity of nonactive ingredients. Your response is inadequate because you did not address your plans for qualification of your component suppliers, did not address your previous commitments to perform identity testing on high-risk components, and failed to clarify whether your firm tested all lots of drug products that you distributed to the United States for risk of (b)(4). You also failed to adequately address quality attributes of your components.\n\nIn response to this letter, provide:\n\nA commitment to provide (b)(4) test results, no later than 30 calendar days from the date of this letter, from testing retains for all lots of high-risk drug components used in the manufacture of drug products. Alternatively, if a retain of a component lot is unavailable, perform retain sample testing of all implicated finished drug product batches for the presence of (b)(4).\nA full risk assessment for drug products that are within expiry which contain any ingredient at risk for (b)(4) contamination (including, but not limited to, (b)(4)). Take prompt and appropriate actions to determine the safety of all lots of the component(s) and any related drug product that could contain (b)(4), including customer notifications and product recalls for any contaminated lots. Identify additional appropriate corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) that secure supply chains in the future, including, but not limited to, ensuring that all incoming raw material lots are from fully qualified manufacturers and free from unsafe impurities. Detail these actions in your response to this letter.\nA description of how you will test each component lot for conformity with all appropriate specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity. If you intend to accept any results from your supplier’s COA instead of testing each component lot for strength, quality, and purity, specify how you will robustly establish the reliability of your supplier’s results through initial validation as well as periodic revalidation. In addition, include a commitment to always conduct at least one specific identity test for each incoming component lot. In the case of (b)(4) and certain additional high-risk components we note that this includes the performance of parts A, B, and C of the USP monograph.\nThe chemical quality control specifications you use to test each incoming lot of high-risk drug components to determine acceptability for use in manufacturing.\nA comprehensive, independent review of your material system to determine whether all suppliers of components, containers, and closures, are each qualified and the materials are assigned appropriate expiration or retest dates. The review should also determine whether incoming material controls are adequate to prevent use of unsuitable components, containers, and closures.\nA procedure governing your program for ongoing control, maintenance, and monitoring that ensures your (b)(4) system consistently produces (b)(4) that meets (b)(4) USP monograph specifications and appropriate microbial limits.\n\n2. Your firm’s quality control unit failed to exercise its responsibility to ensure drug products manufactured are in compliance with CGMP, and meet established specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR 211.22).\n\nYour QU did not provide adequate oversight for the manufacture of your drug products. For example, your QU failed to:\n\nPerform assay testing for the strength of the active ingredient in (b)(4) drug products (21 CFR 211.165(b)).\nEnsure an adequate stability program (including assessment of product potency over the shelf life) to support your claimed (b)(4) expiry for (b)(4) drug products (21 CFR 211.166).\nEnsure that personnel had adequate training and experience for the production and analysis of (b)(4) drug products (21 CFR 211.25(a)).\n\nTesting is essential to ensure that the drug products you manufacture conform to all pre-determined quality attributes appropriate for their intended use. Because you lacked adequate testing of each batch of your drug products, you do not know whether they conform to all appropriate finished product specifications and are suitable for release to consumers.\n\nYou did not ensure that your QU implemented its basic functions. Your management should immediately and comprehensively assess your company’s manufacturing operations to ensure that your systems, processes, and products meet CGMP.\n\nSee FDA’s guidance document Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulations for help implementing quality systems and risk management approaches to meet the requirements of CGMP regulations 21 CFR, parts 210 and 211 at https://www.fda.gov/media/71023/download.\n\nIn response to this letter, provide:\n\nA comprehensive assessment and remediation plan to ensure your QU is given the authority and resources to effectively function. The assessment should also include, but not be limited to:\no A determination of whether procedures used by your firm are robust and appropriate.\no Provisions for QU oversight throughout your operations to evaluate adherence to appropriate practices.\no A complete and final review of each batch and its related information before the QU disposition decision.\no Oversight and approval of investigations and discharging of all other QU duties to ensure identity, strength, quality, and purity of all products.\no Performing a retrospective analysis of all batches shipped to the United States for the past 3 years to ensure product in U.S. commerce meets specifications for potency and purity. Your action plan to address any product quality or patient safety risks for batches of (b)(4) drug products in U.S. distribution, including potential customer notifications and recalls or market withdrawals.\no A copy of the quality agreement with the contract testing laboratories used for finished product testing. Indicate where in this agreement specifies potency testing and provide documentation supporting that potency testing occurs before release of your (b)(4) drug product.\no Justification for the potency discrepancy noted in your response pertaining to product retained testing. Your response demonstrated a (b)(4) potency specification (≤ (b)(4)%) for retained (b)(4) drug products as opposed to your label claim of (b)(4)% (b)(4).\n\n3. Your firm failed to ensure that laboratory records included complete data derived from all tests necessary to ensure compliance with established specifications and standards (21 CFR 211.194(a)).\n\nYour laboratory records lacked complete and original data to support the analyses performed. For example:\n\nYour laboratory records included missing data. Furthermore, there were discrepancies between the original and re-written versions of testing records and COAs pertaining to active and non-active ingredients used in the manufacture of OTC drug products.\nYour firm did not retain original data to support testing of components used to manufacture OTC drug products for the U.S. market. During our inspection, you confirmed that original data, including balance printout slips, (b)(4) times, (b)(4), sample preparations, and equipment logs were not maintained.\nThe use of correction fluid (white-out) was also observed to make corrections on paper records documenting microbial analyses of finished products and raw materials. These documentation practices raise concerns about the integrity, authenticity, and reliability of all your data, and quality of your drug products. Document control is essential to maintaining an adequate quality system.\n\nIn your response, you acknowledge that “QA management did not have a sound understanding of CGMP requirements.” You also commit to performing retrospective testing of “materials,” and state that you have updated procedures and re-trained personnel. Your response is inadequate, as you fail to fully consider comprehensive data integrity (DI) remediation to address the gaps and uncertainties caused by a significant adverse pattern of data that was discarded, lost, or not recorded contemporaneously. Additionally, your response did not consider plans to assess your manufacturing operation’s documentation system to determine where they are insufficient.\n\nReliability of data is fundamentally compromised when there is a failure to record or maintain complete and accurate records of test results, or conditions associated with all tests. Furthermore, the lack of reliable data compromises the quality unit’s (QU) ability to exercise its function of ensuring compliance to applicable standards.\n\nData Integrity Remediation\n\nYour quality system does not adequately ensure the accuracy and integrity of data to support the safety, effectiveness, and quality of the drugs you manufacture. See FDA’s guidance document Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP for guidance on establishing and following CGMP compliant DI practices at https://www.fda.gov/media/119267/download.\n\nWe acknowledge that you are using an independent third-party consultant to perform DI training. However, we strongly recommend that you retain an independent third-party qualified consultant to audit your operation and assist in your DI remediation to meet FDA requirements. In response to this letter, provide:\n\nA comprehensive investigation into the extent of the inaccuracies in data records and reporting. Your investigation should include:\no A detailed investigation protocol and methodology; a summary of all laboratories, manufacturing operations, and systems to be covered by the assessment; and a justification for any part of your operation that you propose to exclude.\no Interviews of current and former employees to identify the nature, scope, and root cause of data inaccuracies. We recommend that these interviews be conducted by a qualified third party.\no An assessment of the extent of DI deficiencies at your facility. Identify omissions, alterations, deletions, record destruction, non-contemporaneous record completion, and other deficiencies. Describe all parts of your facility’s operations in which you discovered DI lapses.\no A comprehensive retrospective evaluation of the nature of the testing and manufacturing DI deficiencies. We recommend that a qualified third party with specific expertise in the area where potential breaches were identified should evaluate all DI lapses.\nA current risk assessment of the potential effects of the observed failures on the quality of your drugs. Your assessment should include analyses of the risks to patients caused by the release of drugs affected by a lapse of DI and analyses of the risks posed by ongoing operations.\nA management strategy for your firm that includes the details of your global CAPA plan. Your strategy should include:\no A detailed corrective action plan that describes how you intend to ensure the reliability and completeness of all the data you generate including analytical data, manufacturing records, and all data submitted to FDA.\no A comprehensive description of the root causes of your DI lapses, including evidence that the scope and depth of the current action plan is commensurate with the findings of the investigation and risk assessment. Indicate whether individuals responsible for DI lapses remain able to influence CGMP-related or drug application data at your firm.\no Interim measures describing the actions you have taken or will take to protect patients and to ensure the quality of your drugs, such as notifying your customers, recalling product, conducting additional testing, adding lots to your stability programs to assure stability, drug application actions, and enhanced complaint monitoring.\no Long-term measures describing any remediation efforts and enhancements to procedures, processes, methods, controls, systems, management oversight, and human resources (e.g., training, staffing improvements) designed to ensure the integrity of your company’s data.\no A commitment to have a qualified consultant conduct extensive annual audits, for at least 2 years, to assist in evaluating CAPA effectiveness after you have executed your DI remediation protocol.\no Inform FDA if you will be hiring a Chief Integrity Officer who is fully empowered to receive anonymous complaints from employees reporting DI concerns and with the authority to ensure any potential breach is promptly investigated (by independent quality assurance function, along with expertise from outside entities whenever needed).\no A status report for any of the above activities already underway or completed.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations.\n\nFDA placed products offered for import into the United States from your firm on Import Alert 66-40 on January 31, 2025.\n\nCorrect any violations promptly. FDA may withhold approval of new applications or supplements listing your firm as a drug manufacturer until any violations are completely addressed and we confirm your compliance with CGMP. We may re-inspect to verify that you have completed corrective actions to any violations.\n\nFailure to address any violations may also result in the FDA continuing to refuse admission of articles manufactured at Yangzhou Sion Commodity Co., Ltd., No. 168 Longwang Road, Hangji Industrial Park, Yangzhou, Jiangsu 225111, China, into the United States under section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3). Articles under this authority that appear to be adulterated [or misbranded] may be detained or refused admission, in that the methods and controls used in their manufacture do not appear to conform to CGMP within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).\n\nThis letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify what you have done to address any violations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as we continue to assess your activities and practices. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state your reasons for delay and your schedule for completion.\n\nSend your electronic reply to CDER-OC-OMQ-Communications@fda.hhs.gov. Identify your response with FEI 3011346498 and ATTN: Samina Khan, Compliance Officer.\n\nSincerely,\n/S/\n\nFrancis Godwin\nDirector\nOffice of Manufacturing Quality\nOffice of Compliance\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research\n\ncc.
