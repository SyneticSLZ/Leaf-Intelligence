      "briefSummary": "This Phase 2 study (protocol number VLS-01-203) will determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of short-term treatment with a VLS-01 transmucosal buccal film (VLS-01-BU) in patients with treatment resistant Major Depressive disorder (TRD) and will characterize the onset and durability of antidepressant effects of VLS-01-BU versus placebo.",
      "detailedDescription": "This Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial will enroll approximately 142 participants with TRD, randomized 1:1 to receive a total of 2 double-blind administrations of VLS- 01-BU (buccal film containing VLS-01) or placebo, administered via the buccal transmucosal route, with a 2-week interval between each administration, during the placebo-controlled treatment period. All participants will have their symptoms monitored for 12 weeks in the placebo- controlled follow-up period, following the second administration of VLS-01-BU or placebo. After the placebo-controlled treatment and observation period all participants will be re-randomized 1:1 to receive one double-blinded administration of VLS-01-BU (dose strength 1 or dose strength 2) during a non-placebo-controlled treatment period. Final safety and efficacy assessment will be conducted two weeks after administration of the third dose."
