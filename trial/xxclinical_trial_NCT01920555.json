One item (i.e., somatic symptoms) is rated on only a 3-point scale, ranging from 0-2. The possible scale range is 0-22, where higher values represent more severe depression. This instrument is completed with a structured interview guide by the clinician based on his/her assessment of the patient's symptoms. This structured interview has been validated for use with time frames shorter than one week. In this study, the HAMD6 was used to assess symptoms occurring in the past 24 hours.",

Items are rated on an 6-point Likert scale, where participants are asked to rate if a specific symptom (e.g. \"How has your mood been over the past 24 hours?\") is normal for him or her (score = 2), what is better than normal (score = 1), and what is worse than normal (scores = 3-6). The total scale score is calculated by averaging across the items, resulting in a possible range from 1 to 6. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity. When rating, patients were asked to consider their symptoms during the past 24 hours.",

It is a clinical interview providing a summary of both ideation and behavior that can be administered during any evaluation or risk assessment to identify the level and type of suicidality present. The C-SSRS can also be used during treatment to monitor for clinical worsening or improvement. It contains 5 rating scale questions (yes/no) for suicidal ideation increasing severity and 5 rating scale questions (yes/no) for suicidal behavior of increasing severity. The time frame is for both lifetime and the past six months for the Baseline/Screening scale and since the last visit for the Since Last Visit scale.",
