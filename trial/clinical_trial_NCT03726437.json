      "briefSummary": "This study evaluates the efficacy of a web-based program for female college freshmen (\"RealConsent\") in reducing their risk of sexual violence victimization. Half the participants will receive RealConsent-F and half will receive an attention-placebo control (\"Stress and Mood Management\").",
      "detailedDescription": "Sexual assault of college women is a serious and complex public health problem: one in five college women report being sexually assaulted. The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial study with 750 female college students from three universities to test the efficacy of RealConsent, a sexual violence risk reduction program for college women, compared to an attention-placebo control. RealConsent is a multi-media 3-hour program based on social cognitive theory and alcohol myopia theory. The primary outcome will be self-reported sexual violence victimization and the secondary outcomes will be alcohol and dating protective- and risk-related behaviors and resistance strategies. The investigators expect that women in the treatment group will report less sexual violence victimization than women in the control group. Expected outcomes are demonstrated feasibility and efficacy of a technologically novel risk reduction program for female college students."

          "description": "A 3-hour web-based program designed to teach female college freshmen strategies to reduce their risk of sexual violence victimization.\n\nRealConsent: This 3-hour web-based program consists of four 45-minute modules that are interactive and range in number of segments (1-14) and types of activities. Each of the modules involves interactivity, didactic activities and two episodes of a serial drama (\"Squad\"), which allow for the modeling of positive behaviors and illustrate both positive and negative outcome expectations. Behaviors modeled include drinking safely (e.g., eating before drinking, pacing, and drinking water), having a game plan before going out, communicating with male sex partners, engaging in protective dating behaviors, use of resistance strategies, self-defense strategies and bystander intervention with the goal of reducing risk of being sexually assaulted.",
