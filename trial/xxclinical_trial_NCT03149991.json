The adequacy of dose and duration of the antidepressant therapy will be determined as per the MGH ATRQ criteria. The TRD status will be confirmed by remote, independent raters from the MGH CTNI who will administer the MGH ATRQ, via teleconference, between the screening visit and the baseline visit.
